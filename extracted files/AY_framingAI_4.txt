Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico becomes the primary reference for the WISeContainer platform and sensors

Algeciras, Spain, Geneva, Switzerland – September 4, 2024: WISeKey International Holding Ltd. ("WISeKey" or
"Company") (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a global leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and Internet of Things
(IoT) innovations, together with its subsidiary WISeSAT and its strategic partner Avant IoT, are pleased to
announce that Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico, in partnership with AvantIoT, is driving the future of smart logistics
by becoming the first reference for the WISeContainer platform and sensors. This innovative initiative was
presented during the APBA Travesía de la Innovación event.

Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico has started equipping its entire fleet of 40 and 45-foot containers with state-of-
the-art WISeContainer IoT sensors. These sensors are designed to enhance container security and provide real-
time tracking and monitoring capabilities. By implementing this innovative technology, Bernardino Abad Grupo
Logístico is establishing the most advanced standards in the logistics industry, improving operational efficiency, and
maximizing the security of goods during transportation operations.

Benefits for Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico and its customers

The implementation of WISeContainer technology brings numerous benefits to Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico.
The real-time tracking capabilities provided by IoT sensors enable constant monitoring of the location and status of
each container, significantly improving asset management and reducing the risk of loss or theft. By having
immediate access to critical data, Bernardino Abad can optimize its logistics operations, reduce downtime and
improve its ability to respond quickly to any unexpected events or delays, as well as defend the interests of its cargo
teams and its customers' goods based on the valuable information the system and sensors provide.

                                                                                                Page 2 of 4

In addition, the advanced security features built into WISeContainer technology protect against unauthorized
access and tampering. This level of security not only safeguards the goods inside the containers, but also helps
Bernardino Abad maintain a high level of trust and reliability with its customers.

Improving customer satisfaction and supply chain transparency

For Bernardino Abad's customers, the integration of WISeContainer's IoT sensors will represent a significant
increase in transparency and customer service. Customers will benefit from instant updates on the status and
location of their shipments, giving them peace of mind and the ability to plan more effectively. Increased visibility
into the supply chain will also enable customers to optimize inventory management, reduce costs associated with
delayed or lost goods, and improve overall operational efficiency.

In addition, the ability to monitor environmental conditions inside containers, such as temperature and humidity,
ensures that goods sensitive to these parameters are transported in optimal conditions, reducing spoilage and
damage. This is particularly beneficial for industries such as pharmaceuticals, food and high-tech products, where
maintaining specific conditions is critical to product quality and safety.

Benefits for ports and the logistics ecosystem in general

The introduction of smart containers equipped with WISeContainer technology also presents substantial benefits to
the ports through which these containers pass. Real-time tracking and monitoring streamlines port operations by
reducing the time required for inspection and processing. Enhanced security measures help prevent theft and
fraudulent cargo handling, contributing to a safer and more secure port environment.

In addition, data collected from WISeContainer sensors can provide valuable information on container flow and port
congestion, enabling ports to optimize their operations and reduce bottlenecks. This contributes to a more efficient
logistics ecosystem, benefiting all parties involved, from logistics companies and shipping lines to freight forwarders
and end customers.

Commitment to innovation and excellence

Together with Wisekey, Avant IoT and Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico are leading the digital transformation of
the logistics sector, demonstrating the immense potential of IoT technology to revolutionize supply chain
management. By adopting innovative solutions such as WISeContainer, Bernardino Abad demonstrates its
commitment to staying ahead of the curve and continuously improving the quality and reliability of its services.

“We are proud to drive this transformation and are already starting to see the positive impact it will have on our
operations and customer satisfaction,” said Bernardino Copano, CEO of Bernardino Abad Grupo Logístico.
