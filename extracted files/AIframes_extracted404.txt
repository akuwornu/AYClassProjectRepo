RPM International Inc. (NYSE: RPM), a world leader in specialty coatings, sealants and building materials, today
reported record financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended February 29, 2024.

"Thanks to the hard work of RPM associates, our third-quarter results demonstrated our continued ability to grow
sales, expand margins and improve cash flow in a mixed economic environment. This is due to our strategic
balance, our focus on repair and maintenance and our MAP 2025 operating improvement initiatives, which are
driving structural financial improvements, and increasing collaboration across our businesses. MAP 2025 was also
a key reason we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of record cash flow from operating activities, which
totaled $1.26 billion during the trailing 12-month period. We continue to reinvest a portion of these gains back into
the business to leverage our entrepreneurial culture and accelerate organic growth," stated Frank C. Sullivan, RPM
chairman and CEO.

"Volume growth in Performance Coatings Group and Construction Products Group, combined with MAP 2025
initiatives and favorable timing of project completions, helped drive a 31.3% increase in consolidated adjusted EBIT
to a third-quarter record. Consumer Group also leveraged MAP 2025 initiatives to generate record adjusted EBIT,
despite continued softness in DIY end markets. While sales and adjusted EBIT declined at Specialty Products
Group, there were signs of stabilization in specialty OEM end markets," Sullivan continued. "Additionally, our
improved coordination in markets outside the U.S. is showing good progress with strong sales and profitability
growth in emerging markets and significant margin expansion in Europe."

Fiscal 2024 sales were a third-quarter record with positive pricing in all segments to catch up with cost inflation.
Volume growth was strongest in businesses that were positioned to serve demand for infrastructure, reshoring, and
high-performance building projects with engineered solutions, and was aided by favorable timing of project
completions. This growth was offset by lower DIY consumer takeaway at retail stores and challenging comparisons
in the disaster restoration business.

Geographically, sales growth was strongest in emerging markets with Africa/Middle East increasing 22.9% and
Latin America increasing 13.5%. Engineered solutions for infrastructure projects were a key driver of the growth in
these markets.

Sales included a 0.9% organic increase, a 0.1% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions, and a 0.4% decline
from foreign currency translation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to incentives to sell higher-margin products and
services; investments to accelerate long-term growth; and inflation in compensation and benefits. These increases
were partially offset by expense reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.

Fiscal 2024 third-quarter adjusted EBIT was a record. Adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 170 basis points was
driven by MAP 2025 initiatives, including the commodity cycle recovery, a positive mix from shifting toward higher
margin products and services, and improved fixed-cost leverage at businesses with volume growth. In Europe,
sales declined slightly, driven by a previously announced divestiture, however, a focused strategy to improve
profitability in the region resulted in strong adjusted EBIT margin expansion.

CPG third-quarter sales were a record with strength in concrete admixtures and repair products as a result of
increased demand for engineered solutions serving infrastructure and reshoring-related projects, as well as market
share gains. Businesses serving high-performance building construction and renovation also performed well. Sales
in Latin America were strong, driven by infrastructure-related demand.

Sales included 3.1% organic growth, 0.7% growth from acquisitions, and 0.5% growth from foreign currency
translation.

Third-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by MAP 2025 benefits, inclusive of the commodity cycle, favorable mix and
improved fixed-cost leverage from volume growth. Variable compensation increased as a result of improved
financial performance and was partially offset by expense reduction actions implemented at the end of fiscal 2023.

PCG generated record third-quarter sales, which were in addition to strong results in the prior-year period, driven by
growth in engineered solutions serving reshoring capital projects, including the favorable timing of some project
completions. Strong growth in Asia/Pacific and Africa/Middle East, which were all recently aligned under PCG, also
contributed to the record sales, driven by demand for engineered solutions serving infrastructure projects.

Sales included 9.2% organic growth, a 0.7% decline from divestitures, and a currency translation headwind of 1.6%.

Record third-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by sales growth, favorable mix, and MAP 2025 benefits, inclusive of
the commodity cycle. Adjusted EBIT growth was achieved in addition to strong results in the prior-year period.

SPG's third-quarter sales decline was driven by challenging comparisons in the prior-year period when the disaster
restoration business had strong results in response to freeze-related flooding that did not reoccur to the same
extent this year, and the impact of the divested non-core furniture warranty business. Specialty OEM end markets
showed signs of stabilization during the quarter.

                                RPM Reports Record Fiscal 2024 Third-Quarter Results

Sales included a 6.4% organic decline, a 1.4% reduction from divestitures, and 0.2% growth from foreign currency
translation.

Adjusted EBIT was negatively impacted by the sales decline and under absorption from lower volumes. The
divestiture of the non-core furniture warranty business also contributed to the adjusted EBIT decline. Investments in
long-term growth initiatives weighed on adjusted EBIT margins and were partially offset by expense-reduction
actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.

         Supplemental Segment Information for details.

The Consumer Group's third-quarter sales decline was driven by weaker DIY takeaway at retail stores, customers
maintaining lean inventories, and the rationalization of lower-margin products, which were partially offset by market
share gains.

Sales included a 3.2% organic decline, no impact from acquisitions, and foreign currency translation headwinds of
0.8%.

Record third-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by margin expansion enabled by MAP 2025 benefits, inclusive of the
commodity cycle, and the rationalization of lower margin products, partially offset by under absorption from lower
volumes, and higher expenses from compensation and benefits.

Cash Flow and Financial Position

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024:
    •   Cash provided by operating activities was $941.1 million compared to $263.0 million in the prior-year
        period.
    •   Capital expenditures were $138.1 million compared to $179.7 million during the prior-year period, driven by
        the timing of investments, including those related to MAP 2025 initiatives.
    •   The company returned $210.1 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.

As of February 29, 2024:
    •   The 12-trailing month cash provided by operating activities was $1.26 billion, compared to $285.8 million in
        the prior year period.
    •   Total debt was $2.19 billion compared to $2.82 billion a year ago, with the $629.2 million reduction driven
        by improved cash flow being used to repay higher cost debt.
    •   Total liquidity, including cash and committed revolving credit facilities, was $1.29 billion, compared to
        $843.5 million a year ago.

"Our strategic balance and consistent execution of MAP 2025 initiatives are expected to drive margin improvements
in the fourth quarter, resulting in the 10th consecutive quarter of record adjusted EBIT, as well as record sales and
adjusted EBIT for the full fiscal year that is squarely in the guidance we previously provided. By segment, the
secular tailwinds of infrastructure and reshoring spending benefitting CPG and PCG are expected to continue,
although PCG will face some temporary headwinds in the fourth quarter from the timing of project completions,
included those that were pulled forward into the third quarter. SPG business conditions have shown early signs of
stabilization, however some end markets remain soft, and the Consumer Group continues to face DIY pressures,"
Sullivan added. "While end markets remain mixed, the investments we are making now position us to accelerate
volume growth when end markets recover and will allow us to fully realize the benefits of the margin achievement
initiatives we have put in place through MAP 2025."

The company expects the following in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter:
    •   Consolidated sales to be approximately flat compared to prior-year record results.
    •   CPG sales to increase in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record
        results.
    •   PCG sales to be approximately flat compared to prior-year record results.
    •   SPG sales to decrease in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year results.
    •   Consumer Group sales to decrease in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record
        results.
    •   Consolidated adjusted EBIT to increase in the high-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year
        record results.

The company expects the following in the full-year fiscal 2024:
    •   Consolidated sales to increase near the midpoint of the previous outlook, which was an increase in the
        low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record results.
    •   Consolidated adjusted EBIT to increase near the midpoint of the previous outlook, which was an increase
        in the low-double-digit to mid-teen percentage range compared to prior-year record results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

To supplement the financial information presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States ("GAAP") in this earnings release, we use EBIT, adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share,
which are all non-GAAP financial measures. EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes, with
adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share provided for the purpose of adjusting for one-off items impacting
revenues and/or expenses that are not considered by management to be indicative of ongoing operations. We
evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before income taxes, but also look to EBIT as a
performance evaluation measure because interest income (expense), net is essentially related to corporate
functions, as opposed to segment operations. For that reason, we believe EBIT is also useful to investors as a
metric in their investment decisions. EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than,
income before income taxes as determined in accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest and
investment income or expense in determining operating performance, which represent items necessary to our
continued operations, given our level of indebtedness. Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful
to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that
this measure is critical to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also
evaluate EBIT because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing. Our underwriters
and bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt
underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be
predictive of potential future results. See the financial statement section of this earnings release for a reconciliation
of EBIT and adjusted EBIT to income before income taxes, and adjusted earnings per share to earnings per share.
We have not provided a reconciliation of our fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 or full-year fiscal 2024 adjusted EBIT
guidance because material terms that impact such measure are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably
predicted, and therefore a reconciliation of such measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

    EBIT

(   The presentation includes a reconciliation of Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes, a measure defined
a   by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP), to EBIT and Adjusted
)   EBIT.

)
(   EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes, with Adjusted EBIT provided for the
c   purpose of adjusting for items impacting earnings that are not considered by management to be
)   indicative of ongoing operations. We evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on
    income before income taxes, but also look to EBIT, or adjusted EBIT, as a performance evaluation
    measure because Interest Income (Expense), Net is essentially related to corporate functions, as
    opposed to segment operations. For that reason, we believe EBIT is also useful to investors as a
    metric in their investment decisions. EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or more
    meaningful than, income before income taxes as determined in accordance with GAAP, since EBIT
    omits the impact of interest and investment income or expense in determining operating performance,

                                                                                                        Page 11 of 17
                      RPM Reports Record Fiscal 2024 Third-Quarter Results

    which represent items necessary to our continued operations, given our level of indebtedness.
    Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating
    agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that this measure is critical
    to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also evaluate EBIT
    because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing. Our underwriters and
    bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any
    debt underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor
    is it meant to be predictive of potential future results.




(   Reflects restructuring and other charges, which have been incurred in relation to our Margin
d   Acceleration Plan ("MAP to Growth") and our Margin Achievement Plan ("MAP 2025"), together MAP
)   initiatives, as follows: - Restructuring and other related expense, net: Includes charges incurred
    related to headcount reductions, facility closures and asset impairments recorded in "Restructuring
    Expense" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring Expense totaled $6.4 million and
    $4.2 million for the quarters ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023, respectively, and $14.1
    million and $6.8 million for the nine months ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023,
    respectively. Other related expenses include inventory write-offs in connection with restructuring
    activities recorded in "Cost of Sales" and accelerated depreciation and amortization recorded within
    "Cost of Sales" or "Selling, General, & Administrative Expenses ("SG&A")" depending on the nature of
    the expense as well as the increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of the
    divestiture of the non-core Universal Sealant's Bridgecare service business within our PCG segment.
    - Exited product lines: Reflects the sale of inventory that had previously been reserved for as a result
    of prior product line rationalization initiatives at PCG partially offset by inventory write-offs related to
    the discontinuation of certain product lines within our SPG segment. These amounts resulted from
    ongoing product line rationalization efforts in connection with our MAP initiatives and were recorded
    within "Cost of Sales". - ERP consolidation plan: Includes expenses incurred as a result of our stated
    goals to consolidate over 75 ERP systems across the organization to four ERP platforms, one per
    segment, as part of our overall MAP strategy as well as costs incurred for other decision support tools
    to facilitate our commercial initiatives related to MAP 2025 which have been incurred in our CPG,
    PCG, SPG and Corporate/Other segments and have been recorded within "SG&A". - Professional
    fees: Includes expenses incurred to consolidate accounting locations, costs incurred to implement
    technologies and processes to drive improved sales mix and salesforce effectiveness and cost
    incurred to implement new global manufacturing methodologies with the goal of improving operating
    efficiency incurred within our CPG, PCG, SPG, and Corporate/Other segments and recorded within
    "SG&A". All of this spend is in support of stated MAP goals with the most significant expense incurred
    within our Corporate/Other segment. - Goodwill impairment: Relates to an impairment charge at our
    Universal Sealants ("USL") reporting unit as a result of a decision to exit the services portion of that
    business which has been recorded in "Goodwill Impairment" recorded in the third quarter of fiscal
    2023. Included below is a reconciliation of the TOTAL CONSOLIDATED MAP initiatives.
