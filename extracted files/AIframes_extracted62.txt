PURCHASE, NY, Jan. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC), the global leader in
whole-person virtual care, today published its fourth annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report. The latest
report highlights the organization’s growing positive impact on communities around the globe—from expanding
access to equitable care and advancing health equity, to further reducing packaging materials to support
sustainability goals. It also follows a landmark year for the company, which surpassed 90 million members as of
September 30, 2023.

“Our continued momentum and unsurpassed scale helped us make an even greater impact this year,” said Jason
Gorevic, chief executive officer of Teladoc Health. “Our CSR work remains integral to our mission to empower all
people everywhere to live their healthiest lives.”

Key highlights from this year’s report include:
    •     Expanding access to high-quality care, including for 1 million people who wouldn’t have otherwise sought
          treatment.
    •     Launching Enterprise Health Equity Data Set (EHEDS) to better understand who we serve and how well
          we are serving them.
    •     Providing financial aid valued at $24 million to cover therapy costs for low-income individuals in 2023,
          through BetterHelp, Teladoc Health’s direct-to-consumer mental health service.
    •     Continuing to innovate our responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with more than 60 AI models
          helping to strengthen and personalize our products and experiences.
