WISeKey subsidiary WISeSat.Space Announces Developments in Secure IoT Connectivity and Climate Monitoring
with European Satellite Independence and Strategic Military Collaboration

Geneva, Switzerland – June 26, 2024: WISeKey International Holding Ltd. (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ:
WKEY), a global leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and Internet of Things (IoT) innovations, today announced
that its subsidiary WISeSat.Space (“Company”) is at the forefront of utilizing low-orbit satellites for secure IoT
connectivity and climate change monitoring with upcoming developments. Planned developments include the
launch of a new generation of satellites, installation of a satellite antenna in Switzerland, development of a neutral
satellite constellation from Europe, and collaboration with the Swiss Army.

In Q4 2024, WISeSat.Space is set to launch a new generation of satellites from California. This launch will mark a
significant milestone in the Company’s efforts to expand its satellite constellation, further enhancing its ability to
provide global IoT connectivity and environmental monitoring. The new generation of satellites are expected to offer
improved performance and capabilities, supporting a wide range of applications from climate change monitoring to
disaster management and smart agriculture.

In the same quarter, WISeSat.Space plans to install a satellite antenna in Switzerland. This installation will enable
the monitoring and management of its satellite constellation, ensuring optimal performance and reliability of its IoT
connectivity solutions. This development underscores WISeSat.Space's commitment to maintaining robust and
secure satellite operations.

                                                                                             Page 2 of 3

The Company is also currently developing a constellation of 88 additional low-orbit satellites to optimize global
coverage for IoT devices and an enhanced WISeSat satellite, planned for launch in Q3 2024. This upgraded
satellite will incorporate SEALSQ Corp. (“SEALSQ”) (NASDAQ: LAES) semiconductor technology and WISeKey
cryptographic keys, designed to boost performance in space and communication capabilities. To date, the
Company has successfully launched 17 low-orbit satellites in cooperation with FOSSA Systems, primarily aboard
SpaceX Transporter Rideshare missions.

An important aspect of WISeSat.Space’s initiative is the development of a dependent and neutral satellite
constellation from Europe. Having a European-based satellite constellation is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it
ensures data sovereignty and reduces reliance on non-European entities for critical data and services. This
autonomy is essential for maintaining control over data security and privacy. Secondly, a neutral European
constellation can facilitate international cooperation and trust, as it is perceived as unbiased and not tied to any
geopolitical agendas. Lastly, it promotes technological independence and innovation within Europe, driving
economic growth and creating high-tech jobs. This European-centric approach aligns with broader strategic goals of
enhancing the region's competitiveness and resilience in the global space sector.

WISeSat.Space has also established a partnership with the Swiss Army, which underscores the strategic
importance of its satellite initiatives. This collaboration involves leveraging WISeSat.Space’s secure IoT connectivity
solutions to enhance the Swiss Army's operational capabilities. By integrating satellite-based communication
systems, the Swiss Army can improve its situational awareness, logistics, and disaster response efforts. This
partnership not only strengthens national security but also exemplifies the critical role of space technology in
modern defense strategies.

Innovative and Critical Technology

WISeSat.Space employs picosatellites and low-power sensors to create a cost-effective and secure IoT
connectivity solution. These picosatellites are smaller and cheaper to launch than traditional satellites, making IoT
connectivity more accessible. The constellation of picosatellites ensures global coverage, providing a reliable
network for data collection and transmission. The low-power sensors are designed to operate with minimal power
consumption, making them ideal for environmental monitoring in remote and off-grid locations. WISeKey's expertise
in cybersecurity ensures that data transmitted through its network is secure and protected from unauthorized
access.

WISeSat.Space's satellite constellation is crucial for continuous environmental monitoring, enabling real-time
detection of changes and providing data for prompt action. These satellites play a significant role in disaster
management by offering early warning systems for extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods.
Enhanced forecasting capabilities assist in planning and mitigating the impacts of climate change on vulnerable
communities and ecosystems. Additionally, high-quality data generated from the satellite constellation supports
informed decision-making and policy formulation aimed at addressing climate change.

WISeSat.Space's initiatives leverage space technology for global IoT connectivity and environmental monitoring,
addressing key challenges in climate change and disaster management, thus contributing to a more resilient and
sustainable future. By developing a neutral satellite constellation from Europe, launching a new generation of
satellites from California, and collaborating with the Swiss Army, along with the installation of a satellite antenna in
Switzerland by November, WISeSat.Space further strengthens its commitment to data security, international
cooperation, and technological advancement.
