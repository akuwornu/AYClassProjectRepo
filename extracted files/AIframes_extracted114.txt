ALEXANDRIA, Virginia, Jan. 30 -- Two inventors, Joseph J. Bango, New Haven, Connecticut, and Michael E.
Dziekan, Bethany, Connecticut, have been awarded a patent (No. US 11887171 B2, initially filed March 8, 2021) for
"Method for ai and cloud network enhanced electric subscriber control of billing and system loads, with contingency
backup."

A system for localized subscriber control of electric provider billing comprising: a digital assistant in communication
with powerline sensors, the powerline sensors configured to detect weather, natural disaster, or other event that
compromises the electric grid in a given predetermined region, a smart utility box in operational communication with
a subscriber's utility connection and in communication with the digital assistant, wherein the smart utility box is
configured to disconnect from a utility and stop incurring charges from the utility if the smart utility box determines
that utility prices may exceed a threshold value. A system of reCAPTCHA comprising: a series of images showing
ice on a powerline, or ice on a powerline, fire on or near a powerline, or other condition that can lead to failure of a
powerline; and a screen to allow users to select the image showing ice on a powerline, or ice on a powerline, fire on
or near a powerline, or other condition that can lead to failure of a powerline which will assist a power system AI
deep learning. A power transmission line monitor comprising a non-transitory computer-readable medium, where
the medium includes a set of instructions stored thereon that when accessed by a processor enable the processor
to perform a method of geolocation awareness for a digital assistant, the method comprising: configuring the power
transmission line monitor to be in communication with a network; configuring the power transmission line monitor to
be in communication with a remote server via the network; configuring the power transmission line monitor to be in
communication with a cloud computing system via the remote server; configuring the power transmission line
monitor to be in communication with the internet such that the present cost of electricity for a given user defined
geographical service area is obtained, and the current cost of electric service in the predefined geographical
location reported, preferably using bluetooth, email, or a digital assistant located in a residence or a business via
the cloud computing system; monitoring temperature, icing of the powerline, electric current in a power transmission

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 2
     Method for Ai and Cloud Network Enhanced Electric Subscriber Control of Billing and System Loads, With
                                            Contingency Backup

line, and three-axis shock above a threshold level, transmitting the temperature, icing condition, electric current, and
three-axis shock information to the remote server.
