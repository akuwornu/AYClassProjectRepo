(TNSrep) -- The Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R48145) on July 30, 2024,
entitled "Legislative Branch: FY2025 Appropriations" by Congress specialist Ida A. Brudnick.

Here are excerpts:

***

SUMMARY

The legislative branch appropriations bill provides funding for the Senate; House of Representatives; Joint Items;
Capitol Police; Office of Congressional Workplace Rights; Congressional Budget Office (CBO); Architect of the
Capitol (AOC); Library of Congress (LOC), including the Congressional Research Service (CRS); Government
Publishing Office (GPO); Government Accountability Office (GAO); Congressional Office for International
Leadership (COIL); and John C. Stennis Center.

The FY2025 Budget Appendix volume was submitted on March 11, 2024 ($7.256 billion, +7.4% from the FY2024
enacted level, including a budget amendment submitted on May 22, which would decrease the legislative branch
request by $4.3 million, Title I only). The House and Senate Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittees
hearings on the requests in April and May.

On May 23, 2024, the House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, held a markup of
the FY2024 bill and ordered it reported by voice vote. On June 13, 2024, the full House Appropriations Committee
marked up the bill and ordered it reported by roll call vote (Roll no. 2, 33-24) (H.R. 8772, H.Rept. 118-555). The
House-reported bill would have provided $5.545 billion, not including Senate items, a $189.2 million increase
(+3.5%) from the comparable FY2024 enacted level. The House Rules Committee met to discuss a rule for
consideration of H.R. 8772 on July 8, 2024. The House adopted the special rule (H.Res. 1341, H.Rept. 118-578) on

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 15
             Congressional Research Service : 'Legislative Branch - FY2025 Appropriations' (Part 1 of 2)

July 9, 2024 (Roll no. 339, 205-201). The House debated H.R. 8772 on July 11, 2024. Four amendments were
considered, and 3 roll call votes were held. H.R. 8772 failed to pass in the House (205-213; Roll no. 352).

On July 11, 2024, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2025 legislative branch
appropriations bill. The committee ordered the bill reported by a vote of 27-0. The bill, as amended, would provide
$4.913 billion (not including House items). This level represents a $181.1 million increase (+3.8%) from the
comparable FY2024 enacted level.

Previously

* The FY2024 level of $6.749 billion represented a decrease of $157.7 million, or -2.3%, when compared to the
"grand total" for FY2023; or a decrease of $144.0 million, or -2.1%, when considering Title I only.

* The FY2023 level of $6.899 billion (not including supplemental appropriations of $7.5 million) represented an
increase of $975.2 million (+16.5%) from the FY2022 level.

* The FY2022 level of $5.924 billion represented an increase of $618.8 million (+11.7%) from the FY2021 level, not
including the FY2021 supplemental.

* The FY2021 level of $5.304 billion represented an increase of $255.0 million (+5.1%) from the FY2020 level, not
including the FY2021 supplemental.

* The FY2020 level of $5.049 billion represented an increase of $202.8 million (+4.2%) from the FY2019 level, not
including the FY2020 supplemental.

* The FY2019 level of $4.836 billion represented an increase of $136.0 million (+2.9%) from FY2018, not including
the FY2019 supplemental.

* The FY2018 level of $4.700 billion represented an increase of $260.0 million (+5.9%) from FY2017.

* The FY2017 level of $4.440 billion represented an increase of $77.0 million (+1.7%) from FY2016.

* The FY2016 level of $4.363 billion represented an increase of $63.0 million (+1.5%) from FY2015.

* The FY2015 level of $4.300 billion represented an increase of $41.7 million (+1.0%) from FY2014.

* The FY2014 level of $4.259 billion represented an increase of $198 million (+4.9%) from FY2013.

* The FY2013 level of $4.061 billion represented a decrease of $246 million (-5.6%), including the sequestration
and rescission, from FY2012.

The smallest of the appropriations bills, the legislative branch bill comprises approximately 0.4% of total
discretionary budget authority.

Submission of FY2025 Budget Request on March 11, 2024

The FY2025 Budget Appendix volume, which includes the legislative branch budget request, was submitted on
March 11, 2024.

The budget included a note accompanying each account addressing timing, since the FY2025 budget submission
occurred prior to the enactment of FY2024 funding on March 23, 2024. The paragraph stated:/1

'Note. - A full-year 2024 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the Budget was prepared;
therefore, the Budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 and Other
Extensions Act (Division A of Public Law 118-15, as amended). The amounts included for 2024 reflect the
annualized level provided by the continuing resolution.'

Additionally, as explained annually by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):/2

'The budget covers the agencies of all three branches of Government--Executive, Legislative, and Judicial--and
provides information on Government-sponsored enterprises. In accordance with law or established practice, OMB
includes information on agencies of the Legislative Branch, the Judicial Branch, and certain Executive Branch
agencies as submitted by those agencies without change.'

The independence of the submissions by the legislative branch agencies and entities is codified in Title 31, Section
1105, of the U.S. Code, which states the following:/3

'Estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations for the legislative branch and the judicial branch to be
included in each budget ... shall be submitted to the President ... and included in the budget by the President
without change.'

Furthermore, Division C of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74) added language to Title 31,
Section 1107, relating to budget amendments, stating the following:

'The President shall transmit promptly to Congress without change, proposed deficiency and supplemental
appropriations submitted to the President by the legislative branch and the judicial branch.'

                                                                                                  Page 6 of 15
           Congressional Research Service : 'Legislative Branch - FY2025 Appropriations' (Part 1 of 2)

On May 22, 2024, the President submitted a budget amendment, which stated/4

'This transmittal also contains one FY 2025 Budget amendment for the Legislative Branch. As a matter of comity
and tradition, this appropriations request for the Legislative Branch is transmitted without change. This amendment
would decrease by $4 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2025 Budget.'

The budget amendment addressed the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services (a revised request of $1.8
million).

On May 23, 2024, the House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, held a markup of
the FY2025 bill. The subcommittee recommended $5.545 billion, a $189.2 million increase (+3.5%) from the

not included in the House bill).

No amendments were offered, and the bill was ordered to be reported to the full committee by voice vote.

House Appropriations Committee Markup of the FY2025 Bill (H.R. 8772, H.Rept. 118-555)

legislative branch bill, was agreed to in the House on July 9, 2024 (Roll no. 339, 205-201).

House Consideration and Failure on Passage of H.R. 8772

The House debated H.R. 8772 on July 11, 2024.

Pursuant to the provisions of H.Res. 1341, the amendments printed in H.Rept. 118-578 were in order.

The House considered four amendments and held roll call votes on three of them:

1. An amendment offered by Representative Huizenga, which would have prohibited the use of funds in the act for
the Congressional Office of International Leadership. The amendment failed (169-240, Roll no. 348).

2. An amendment offered by Representative Ogles (and managed in the House by Representative Self), which
would have prohibited the use of funds in the act to impose a COVID-19 mask mandate. This amendment was
agreed to by voice vote.

3. An amendment offered by Representative Self, which would have prohibited funds in the act from going toward
the charging of electric vehicles in the Capitol Complex. The amendment failed (149-262, Roll no. 349).

4. An amendment offered by Representative Jackson (TX), which would have reduced funding for the Office of the
Attending Physician to FY2020 levels. The amendment failed (128-289, Roll no. 350).

A motion to recommit failed (206-211, Roll no. 351).

H.R. 8772 failed on passage in the House (205-213, Roll no. 352).

Consideration of 302(b) Levels

On July 11, 2024, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2025 legislative branch
appropriations bill. The bill was ordered reported by a vote of 27-0.

One amendment was adopted during the markup, which amended bill language in Section 208 of the general
provisions "to remove the ability for legislative branch agencies to seek a waiver" related to telecommunications
equipment procurement./8

The bill, as amended, would provide $4.913 billion (not including House items). This level represents a $181.1
million increase (+3.8%) from the comparable FY2024 enacted level.

Funding in Prior Years: Brief Overview and Trends

Legislative Branch: Historical Percentage of Total Discretionary Budget Authority

The percentage of total discretionary budget authority provided to the legislative branch has remained relatively
stable at approximately 0.4% since at least FY1976./9

The maximum level, not including the transition quarter,/10 was in FY1995 (0.48%), and the minimum was in
FY2020 (0.28%).

FY2024

FY2024 funding was provided in Division E of the FY2024 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 118-47),
which was enacted on March 23, 2024. The act provided $6.749 billion, a decrease of $157.7 million, or -2.3%,
when compared to the "grand total" for FY2023 (or a decrease of $144.0 million, or -2.1%, when considering Title I
only).

9 Calculations by CRS with data from Office of Management and Budget (OMB), "Table 5.4 - Discretionary Budget
Authority By Agency: 1976-2029," in Historical Tables, Budget of the United States Government, FY2025,
https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/. The calculations have some limitations, since the OMB data do
not completely align with items funded in the annual and supplemental legislative branch appropriations acts. The
differences may be partially traced to the definition of "legislative branch" in the OMB Public Budget Database
user's guide. Some entities regularly included with the legislative branch in many OMB budget documents, like the
U.S. Tax Court and some Legislative Branch Boards and Commissions, are not funded through the annual
legislative branch appropriations acts. Consequently, an examination of the discretionary budget authority listed in
the Historical Tables reveals some differences with the reported total budget authority provided in the annual
legislative branch appropriations acts. The difference in legislative branch budget authority resulting from the
different definitions of the legislative branch in the OMB budget documents and in the appropriations acts, however,
does not represent a significant difference in the proportion of total discretionary budget authority.

10 "Prior to 1977, the fiscal year began on July 1 and ended on June 30 ... Fiscal year 1976 ended on June 30,
1976, and fiscal year 1977 began on October 1, 1976. The period July 1, 1976, to September 30, 1976, is called
the 'transition quarter' or TQ." (Office of Management and Budget, Budget Analysis Branch, Public Budget

FY2018

FY2018 funding was provided in Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), which was
enacted on March 23, 2018. The $4.700 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $260.0 million
(+5.9%) from the FY2017 enacted level.

In addition, P.L. 115-123, enacted February 9, 2018, provided $14.0 million to GAO "for audits and investigations

FY2017

FY2017 funding was provided in Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), which was
enacted on May 5, 2017. The $4.440 billion provided by the act represented a $77.0 million increase (+1.7%) from
the FY2016 enacted level.

FY2016

FY2016 funding was provided in Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), which was
enacted on December 18, 2015. The $4.363 billion provided by the act represented a $63.0 million increase
(+1.5%) from the FY2015 enacted level.

FY2015

FY2015 funding was provided in Division H of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015
(P.L. 113-235), which was enacted on December 16, 2014. The $4.300 billion provided by the act represented an
increase of $41.7 million (+1.0%) from FY2014.

FY2014

Neither a legislative branch appropriations bill nor a continuing resolution (CR) containing FY2014 funding was
enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial
government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR (P.L. 113-
46) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014./14

Following enactment of a CR on January 15, 2014 (P.L. 113-73), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on
January 17 (P.L. 113-76), providing $4.259 billion for the legislative branch for FY2014.

FY2013

                                                                                                  Page 13 of 15
            Congressional Research Service : 'Legislative Branch - FY2025 Appropriations' (Part 1 of 2)

FY2013 funding of approximately $4.061 billion was provided by P.L. 113-6, which was signed into law on March
26, 2013./15

The act funded legislative branch accounts at the FY2012 enacted level, with some exceptions (also known as
"anomalies"), not including across-the-board rescissions required by Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6. Section 3004 was
intended to eliminate any amount by which the new budget authority provided in the act exceeded the FY2013
discretionary spending limits in Section 251(c)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as
amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-
240). Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6, OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of security
budget authority and 0.2% of nonsecurity budget authority would be required. The act did not alter the sequestration
reductions implemented on March 1, which reduced most legislative branch accounts by 5.0%./16

The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in each account
containing nonexempt funds.17

FY2012 and Prior

Division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74) provided $4.307 billion for the legislative
branch. This level was $236.9 million below (-5.2%) the FY2011 enacted level. P.L. 112-10 provided $4.543 billion
for legislative branch operations in FY2011. This level represented a $125.1 million decrease (-2.7%) from the
$4.668 billion provided in the FY2010

branch budget authority of $4.061 billion, noting that it "includes effects of the 2013 sequestration." This bill
contained a small anomaly for the legislative branch.

Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-68) and the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-
212). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.402 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25.0 million was
provided for GAO in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009./18

P.L. 111-32, the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for a new Capitol Police radio
system ($71.6 million) and additional funding for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ($2.0 million)./19

As seen in Table 3, in current dollars, legislative branch funding decreased each year from FY2010 through
FY2013, and it did not exceed the FY2010 level until FY2018. Adjusted for inflation, the FY2022 funding level was
slightly less than the FY2010 level.20 The FY2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act was the first to fund the
legislative branch at a higher level than provided for FY2010, in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Notes: Each row represents consideration during the calendar year of the subsequent fiscal year spending bill (i.e.,
the calendar year 1995 row shows the timeline of consideration and passage of the FY1996 act). Arrows in the
December column indicate consideration continued into the next calendar year. The figure shows when the
committee report was filed, which may be later than the date the bill was ordered to be reported. When House and
Senate action occurs on the same date, the House is shown first. The FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations
Act (P.L. 111-68) is listed in this figure as stand-alone legislation (Division A), although it was also the vehicle for a
continuing appropriations resolution (Division B).
