Indonesia awards Intermap $20 million contract to map 10% of the country in 2024

Follow-on task orders to map the remaining 90% expected over the subsequent four years

Intermap’s proprietary IFSAR technology enables unique country-wide mapping solution to achieve unprecedented
specifications

DENVER, Jan. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intermap Technologies (TSX: IMP; OTCQB: ITMSF) (“Intermap”
or the “Company”), a global leader in 3D geospatial products and intelligence solutions, today announced it has
won a $20 million contract to map the Island of Sulawesi, Indonesia in 2024 (the “Contract”). The Contract is the
first phase of the Indonesian national topographic basemap program to create a national digital basemap as part of
the One Map program backed by Presidential Decree. Under the One Map program’s approved technical
specifications, the government will collect airborne IFSAR-derived elevation data and cloud-free radar imagery for
the entire country at resolutions suitable for 1:5,000 scale mapping. The first phase awarded today represents 10%
of the country’s land area and 10% of the One Map program. Work on the remaining 90% is expected over the
subsequent four years.

Indonesia’s national geospatial agency, Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG), has been mandated to create a national
digital basemap. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country and one of the largest and fastest-growing
economies in Southeast Asia, strategically positioned on the major trade route through the South China Sea.
Basemaps play a critical role in policy formation, decision-making and implementation of activities such as natural
resource management, disaster response and spatial planning. Creating basemaps to the 1:5,000 scale
specification requires high-resolution remote sensing data, including imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs),
to extract details like buildings, roads, land cover and terrain features. Indonesia is home to the�world’s largest
tropical peatlands and mangrove forests as well as the third largest tropical rainforest. These natural resources are

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3

vital in capturing carbon, helping mitigate climate change impacts, and are key resources for supporting Indonesia’s
long-term development. Basemaps are essential for developing spatial plans, emergency response and natural
disaster rehabilitation.

The Contract procurement to achieve this objective included a competitive process, which evaluated multiple
commercial airborne and satellite technologies and sensors. Today’s award represents one of the largest single-
source topographic mapping programs ever and demonstrates that national mapping agencies value Intermap’s
unique airborne, native-3D Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) collection, high-quality elevation data
and rapid processing technology. Intermap and its partners will utilize Intermap’s IFSAR to map the entire Island of
Sulawesi, an area of more than 180,000 square kilometers. No other company can meet Indonesia’s technical
requirements within the budget and timeframe allotted by the Contract.

Intermap has an exclusive partnership with the subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise, PT Pratama Persada
Airborne (PPA), which leverages the strengths of both parties. The partnership combines Intermap’s cutting-edge,
patented IFSAR collection technology and data processing expertise with PPA’s extensive local knowledge,
resources and government support. Together, the companies provide an unparalleled mapping solution for this first
phase of the Indonesian national mapping program and future work under the One Map program.

Today’s Contract is expected to be the first phase of the One Map program to map approximately 17,000 islands,
spanning Indonesia’s entire territory, covering equatorial Southeast Asia. The follow-on contract is expected to take
four years and will complete the foundation basemap, with additional agreements to support the maintenance of the
basemap.

“This major contract in Indonesia highlights the value of our decades of experience, commercialization expertise
and technological development,” said Patrick A. Blott, Intermap Chairman and CEO. “We have had a presence in
Indonesia since the 1990s and have received numerous contracts over the past two decades. The progression of
our technology, our exploitation of relevant data to drive valuable commercial use cases and the expansion of our
operations in Indonesia are a testament to our ability to respond to challenging client requirements — in this case,
in-country processing, stringent data specifications and ability to work closely with the local surveying, mapping,
government and business communities.”

Indonesia is located in the cloud belt, often blanketed with persistent cloud cover, and mostly composed of rural
areas and dense tropical rainforests. IFSAR technology is the only mapping solution that offers cloud-penetrating
and foliage-penetrating capabilities at the resolutions required to achieve 1:5,000 scale mapping. Intermap’s IFSAR
is approved by the Indonesian government as a preferred technology, capable of achieving the required basemap
standards. This award demonstrates the high degree of confidence Indonesia has for the collection and processing
capabilities of Intermap and its partners. Indonesia plans to commercialize the data and Intermap is uniquely
positioned to contribute its extensive experience and capabilities to create exploitation tools for applications such as
flood mapping, navigation, resource management and infrastructure monitoring.

Under the terms of the Contract, which is subject to additional amended terms and conditions regarding
subcontractors for the final allocation of taxes for goods and services, Intermap will provide collection, processing
and delivery of high-quality elevation data and imagery data as part of a consortium of other local operators. The
entire area will be captured using airborne IFSAR, a SAR-based native 3D collection technology with quality and
precision that cannot be duplicated with spaceborne sensors. After an extensive, multiyear evaluation process with
the country’s expert SAR community, airborne IFSAR was identified as the only technology that could meet the
government’s ambitious specifications for accuracy and detail. Intermap’s sensors and technology collect 25-
centimeter resolution IFSAR imagery and produce 0.50-meter resolution digital surface models, 1-meter resolution
digital terrain models, and feature products, including triple canopy foliage penetration, for foundational basemaps.
Intermap’s proprietary IFSAR co-registered X- and P-band sensors will be deployed on one of its STAR-3 high-
altitude, wholly-owned Learjet platforms. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, the
Company’s patented IRIS™ and LENS processing engines enable country-scale processing at speed by
automatically extracting primary features from our aerial SAR as well as multi-sourced data, including high-
frequency and low-frequency radar, multi-spectral imagery, LiDAR, satellite SAR, optical sensors, aerial photo and
