“Fiscal 2024 was a successful year for us, ranking as the third highest revenue in our history, despite facing
declining commodity prices and challenging financing conditions for junior and intermediate mining companies
throughout calendar 2023,” said Denis Larocque, President and CEO of Major Drilling. “We continued to invest in
our equipment, innovation, and field crews, anticipating that future demand will require significantly more drilling
activity to address the supply shortfall issues currently driving commodity prices. Mineral exploration efforts are now
at less than 60% of those seen at the peak in 2012, even as gold and copper prices have recently hit record highs
due to supply not keeping pace with demand.”

“As expected, the fourth quarter saw a slow start in North America due to delayed mobilizations and reduced junior
and intermediate funding. This was partly offset by increased activity from areas more exposed to copper like Chile,
Mongolia and Brazil, which we expect to continue to grow.”

“Despite a challenging start, the Company generated $25.3 million in EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2024. We
experienced our typical fourth quarter ramp-up in working capital associated with increasing levels of activity
throughout the quarter and finished the year in a strong financial position with $87.4 million in net cash,” said Ian
Ross, CFO of Major Drilling. “As part of the ongoing effort to maintain our industry leading fleet and support gear,
while positioning the Company for heightened activity levels, we spent $18.5 million on capex during the quarter.
This included the purchase of 7 new drill rigs, while we disposed of 6 older, less efficient rigs, bringing the total rig
count to 606. Our annual capex spend of $74 million in fiscal 2024 allowed us to meet the rigorous standards of our
growing senior mining customer base as we prioritized the latest technologies and innovative solutions, including
hands-free rod handling,” concluded Mr. Ross.

“Throughout fiscal 2024, I have been proud of our investments and advancements in strategic innovation and the
partnerships we have built with our key customers. We have developed cutting-edge technologies, such as
digitizing our rigs to capture drilling data and introducing analytics to optimize drilling operations, and more recently,
we are working to leverage our drilling data to help in the development of customer models. We anticipate exciting
progress in this area as we continue to strategically exploit solutions to further integrate our skills, data, and
processes into the services we provide our customers,” said Mr. Larocque.

“As we move into our first quarter of fiscal 2025, drilling activity is returning to last year's levels, while looking ahead
to fiscal 2025 and beyond, the outlook for Major Drilling remains positive amidst current market dynamics. As a
reminder, copper and gold typically account for 65 to 75% of our activity. Demand for copper is projected to rise

                                                                                                         Page 3 of 14

rapidly as substantial infrastructure investments are required for the green transition, and the anticipated artificial
intelligence revolution. Industry experts predict this will result in significant supply deficits in the coming years,
creating an urgent need to replenish reserves. Over the past three months, copper prices have surged by 35%,
recently hitting record highs of $5.00 per pound due to concerns over supply shortages.”

“The decline in gold reserves among most senior mining companies highlights the urgent need for increased
exploration to discover new gold deposits. Mineral reserves are down 35% from 2012 and supply is limited.
Coupled with heightened demand from various sectors such as investment, technology, and jewelry, this has
exerted upward pressure on gold prices as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainties and
geopolitical tensions. Consequently, we are seeing senior gold customers increasingly prioritize value-adding
grassroots exploration and development in order to replenish their reserves to meet future demand.”

“We also expect the demand for other battery metals such as nickel, zinc, lithium, and even silver, which comprise
the majority of the remaining activity in our industry, to continue to grow as the prominence of electric vehicles, solar
panels, and the general electrification of the global infrastructure grows.”

“Despite the pressing need to replenish mineral reserves for both gold and battery metals, the industry is still in the
early stages of the exploration cycle. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, global non-ferrous exploration
budgets were at $12.8 billion in 2023, which is only 60% of the $21.5 billion spent at the peak of the last cycle in
2012. The mining industry remains in the discovery phase and will need to undergo an intensive, multi-year infill
drilling period to develop new mines and address the projected supply gaps in various commodities. Many of these
new mineral deposits will be in challenging, hard-to-reach areas, necessitating complex drilling solutions and
increasing the demand for Major Drilling’s specialized services.”

“Our position as the leader in specialized drilling continues to be a factor in attracting business from senior
companies, and we are proud to maintain the industry's largest, most modern fleet. To strengthen our leadership
position in the industry, the Company expects to spend approximately $65 million in capital expenditures in fiscal
2025, including more investments to equip our rigs with the latest technology,” concluded Mr. Larocque.

Fourth Quarter Ended April 30, 2024

Total revenue for the quarter was $168.0 million, down 9.2% from revenue of $185.0 million recorded in the same
quarter last year. The unfavourable foreign exchange translation impact on revenue for the quarter, when
comparing to the effective rates for the same period last year, was approximately $2 million, with minimal impact on
net earnings as expenditures in foreign jurisdictions tend to be in the same currency as revenue.

Revenue for the quarter from Canada - U.S. drilling operations decreased by 25.4% to $74.5 million, compared to
the same period last year, as a lack of junior and intermediate funding and program delays continue to negatively
impact this region.

South and Central American revenue increased by 9.3% to $49.3 million for the quarter, compared to the same
quarter last year, as increased copper activity continues to drive the growth in this region.

Australasian and African revenue increased by 10.2% to $44.2 million, compared to the same period last year, as
this region has also been positively impacted by the increased activity levels for copper.

Gross margin percentage for the quarter was 19.3%, compared to 25.0% for the same period last year.
Depreciation expense, totaling $12.8 million, is included in direct costs for the current quarter, versus $10.8 million
in the same quarter last year. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes depreciation expense, was 26.9% for the
quarter, compared to 30.8% for the same period last year. Program delays in North America were the main driver of
reduced margins in the quarter as the Company strategically retained extra drilling labour to prepare for heightened
activity levels in the coming months.

General and administrative costs were $17.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the same quarter last
year. Increased inflationary wage adjustments make up the majority of the increase compared to the prior year.

                                                                                                         Page 4 of 14
                       Major Drilling Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results

Other expenses were $3.0 million, down from $4.0 million in the prior year quarter, due to a decrease in the annual
allowance for doubtful accounts as well as lower incentive compensation expenses given the decreased profitability
as compared to the prior year quarter.

The income tax provision for the quarter was an expense of $2.4 million, compared to an expense of $5.3 million for
the prior year period. The decrease in the income tax provision was related to an overall reduction in profitability.

Net earnings were $9.9 million or $0.12 per share ($0.12 per share diluted) for the quarter, compared to net
earnings of $20.8 million or $0.25 per share ($0.25 per share diluted) for the prior year quarter.

Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2024

Total revenue for the year was $706.7 million, down 4% from revenue of $735.7 million recorded in the previous
year. The favourable foreign exchange translation impact, when comparing to the effective rates for the previous
year, was approximately $6 million on revenue, while net earnings were less impacted at approximately $1 million,
as expenditures in foreign jurisdictions tend to be in the same currency as revenue.

Revenue for the year from Canada – U.S. decreased by 15% to $344.9 million, compared to the previous year. This
region continues to be negatively impacted by financing constraints for the junior and intermediate miners, causing
a decrease in activity from the prior year.

South and Central American revenue increased by 12% to $187.4 million for the year, compared to the previous
year. This increase was driven by busy markets in Chile as the demand for battery metals is having a positive
impact, and the Guiana Shield region, which is benefiting from historically high gold prices throughout the fiscal
year. The growth in these regions more than offset reduced activity levels in Mexico and Argentina due to a
subdued investment sentiment for mining.

Australasian and African revenue increased by 6% to $174.4 million, compared to the previous year. Strong
demand for the Company's specialized services in Australia and energy work in Mongolia were responsible for the
year-over-year growth.

Gross margin percentage for the year was 21.6%, compared to 24.0% for the previous year. Depreciation expense
totaling $47.8 million is included in direct costs for the current year, versus $43.7 million in the prior year. Adjusted
gross margin, which excludes depreciation expense, was 28.4% for the year, compared to 30.0% for the prior year.
The decrease in margins from the prior year was mainly attributable to reduced activity levels and a competitive
environment in our North American markets.

General and administrative costs were $68.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million, compared to the previous
year. The majority of this increase was due to inflationary wage adjustments.

Other expenses were $10.3 million, down from $13.4 million in the prior year, due primarily to lower incentive
compensation expenses throughout the Company, given the decreased profitability.

Foreign exchange loss was $5.5 million, compared to $2.8 million for last year. While the Company's reporting
currency is the Canadian dollar, various jurisdictions have net monetary assets or liabilities exposed to other
currencies. Despite the Company's best efforts to minimize exposure, the loss from Argentina was $4.1 million as
they experienced a significant devaluation of the Peso as part of economic reforms implemented by the new
Argentinian government.

The income tax provision for the year was an expense of $17.9 million, compared to an expense of $22.7 million for
the prior year. The decrease was driven by an overall decrease in profitability compared to the prior year.

Net earnings were $53.1 million or $0.64 per share ($0.64 per share diluted) for the year, compared to $74.9 million
or $0.90 per share ($0.90 per share diluted) for the prior year.

and assumptions are considered reasonable by the Company as at the date of this document in light of
management’s experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, these statements are
inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and
unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that include, but are not limited
to: the level of activity in the mining industry and the demand for the Company’s services; competitive pressures;
global and local political and economic environments and conditions; the level of funding for the Company’s clients
(particularly for junior mining companies); exposure to currency movements (which can affect the Company’s
revenue in Canadian dollars); the integration of business acquisitions and the realization of the intended benefits of
such acquisitions; efficient management of the Company’s growth; currency restrictions; safety of the Company’s
workforce; risks and uncertainties relating to climate change and natural disaster; the Company’s dependence on
key customers; the geographic distribution of the Company’s operations; the impact of operational changes;
changes in jurisdictions in which the Company operates (including changes in regulation); failure by counterparties
to fulfill contractual obligations; disease outbreak; as well as other risk factors described under “General Risks and
Uncertainties” in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended April 30, 2024, available on the SEDAR+ website at
www.sedarplus.ca. Should one or more risk, uncertainty, contingency, or other factor materialize or should any
factor or assumption prove incorrect, actual results could vary materially from those expressed or implied in the
forward-looking information.

Forward-looking statements made in this document are made as of the date of this document and the Company
disclaims any intention and assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, even if new information
becomes available, as a result of future events, or for any other reasons, except as required by applicable securities
laws.
