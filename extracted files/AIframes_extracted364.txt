PR NewswireNew Orleans-based Footprint Project deploys renewable energy equipment to communities affected
by climate disasters and humanitarian crisesThe nonprofit is getting ready to support the Gulf Coast of the U.S.,
which forecasters predict could have an active hurricane seasonBOSTON, June 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --
Schneider Electric, the global leader in digital transformation of energy management, today announced a donation
of $250,000 to theFootprint Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating sustainable energy solutions for
disaster relief efforts. The funds will support the deployment of solar-powered microgrids in areas of the United
States affected by climate emergencies, providing reliable clean energy to first responders and affected residents.

 Footprint Project's mission is to help build back greener after climate disasters by mobilizing cleaner energy
infrastructure to communities in crisis. They enhance disaster response capabilities by leveraging sustainable
technologies, and microgrids play a crucial role in achieving this goal. The nonprofit's mobile units combine solar
panels with battery storage, allowing them to generate and store electricity independently. When deployed, they
provide essential power for charging devices, refrigeration, Wi-Fi, power tools, water production, and other critical
needs."Whether it's charging your phone, powering laptops to complete critical paperwork, generating power to
make purified water, or keeping the lights on in an emergency command center, the Footprint Project's mobile
microgrids help to solve energy needs during climate emergencies," said Jana Gerber, President of North America
Microgrids for Schneider Electric. "It's an honor to work with Footprint Project's dedicated team of professionals.
Their vision for energy resiliency aligns perfectly with our mission of sustainability."Since its inception in 2018, the
Footprint Project has undertaken 25 disaster and recovery missions, including responding to the Mississippi
tornadoes in spring 2023 and the wildfires in Maui last August. The nonprofit partners with volunteer organizations,
government agencies, community leaders, emergency responders, utility companies, local households of faith, and
others crucial to disaster recovery efforts."We greatly appreciate the support of Schneider Electric as we work to
be there for those affected by climate disasters and humanitarian crises," said Jamie Swezey, Program Director for
the Footprint Project. "We have already seen tremendous damage from tornados this year and are expecting an
active hurricane season along the Gulf Coast, so donations like this help us put energy resources where they are
needed most during these emergencies. Further, by providing sustainable energy alternatives, we're working to
ensure that communities affected by such disasters have access to reliable power without relying on fossil
fuels."Over the past four years, Schneider Electric has donated $1.7 million in funding and electrical products to the
Footprint Project. Schneider's donations have enabled the Footprint Project to expand its reach and enhance
disaster resilience. The company provides design and engineering support to the nonprofit and supplies electrical

components for their mobile microgrids.Recently 30 Schneider Electric volunteers from the U.S., Canada, and
Mexico also participated in the construction of solar-powered mobile microgrids during a "Build Power" event at the
company's Nashville Hub. These new mobile, solar-powered microgrids will be made available at no cost to
community resilience partners across the Gulf Coast and Appalachia, providing free, sustainable electricity for those
working on the frontlines of the global climate emergency.The Footprint Project is currently focused on providing
response and long-term recovery efforts in communities impacted by this year's storm season like Texas, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, and Kentucky, as well as preparing to deploy assistance to states during hurricane season.The
partnership with the Footprint Project exemplifies how Schneider Electric is striving for corporate responsibility and
environmental stewardship. To donate, please visithttps://www.footprintproject.org.Earlier this week, Schneider
