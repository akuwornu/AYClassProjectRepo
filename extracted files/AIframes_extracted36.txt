Body


Good morning, Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member Grassley, and Members of the Commitee. Thank you for
inviting me to testify at this hearing to explore the implications of climate risk on the municipal bond market. It is an
honor to do so, and to represent the hard work of many colleagues and collaborators.

My name is Chris Hartshorn, and currently I serve as an advisor to numerous environmental data science-enabled
starts-ups focusing on nature and biodiversity, carbon credits and markets, and a NASA spin-out focused on next
generation weathering modeling and forecasting. I also advise a venture capital firm that has most recently closed a
fund focused on decarbonization of hard to abate industries, wherein the limited partners are comprised of
corpora.ons from those very industries, as well as a start-up developing a new carbon capture material.

More relevant for this hearing were my many years fully dedicated to building two start-ups focused on climate risk
to US fixed income debt instruments, risQ and Level 11 Analytics, both now acquired by Intercontinental Exchange.
risQ, in particular, became the leading provider of physical climate risk data for the municipal bond market and a
large number of its participants.

I'd note at the outset how much of the discussion at this commitee's July 26th, 2023 hearing on The Fiscal
Consequences of Climate Change on Infrastructure is pertinent here, given how much infrastructure is provided as
a part of municipal services. The insights of that hearing don't need my regurgitation. It is important to note,
however, that the municipals as de.ned by the municipal bond market, rather than "just" cities or the infrastructure
discussed that day, is a vast diaspora of overlapping debt issuers covering states, counties, utilities, school districts,
transit systems, airports, hospital systems, charter schools, retirement communities, cities and many more. The
implications of climate-mitigative, -adaptive and -resilient actions to the population are even broader and starker
under this financial market municipal definition.

With respect to climate risk, it is easiest to conceptualize property-destroying, evacuation-invoking perils -
hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and the like - as these "acute" events happen quickly, catalyze local and often federal
emergency responses, have quantifiable economic consequences and replacement costs, and leave single name
scars - Katrina, Sandy, Paradise - to name just three. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra.on

  Senate Budget Committee Hearing "Investing in the Future: Safeguarding Municipal Bonds from Climate Risk."
                             Testimony by Chris Hartshorn, Advisor, Zeus AI

(NOAA) documented 25 such acute events in the US each with at least $1 billion in costs in 2023 - a CPI-adjusted
record for any year. n1

Climate risks are clearly material to municipal .finance. Taking wildfires as one example, in the five years after a fire
the net fiscal effect of wildfires on a municipality is a decline in excess revenues of $97 per capita - equivalent to
10.7% the per capita budget size - and a 25% increase in the probability of a budget deficit. n2 For hurricanes, local
governments experience significant declines in revenues, expenditures, and debt in the 10 years after a hurricane
strike. These declines are initially offset by intergovernmental transfers in the immediate aftermath of a hurricane
but ramp up significantly after 6-10 years post hurricane. n3 The impacts of past floods - inland and coastal - also
liter the Official Statements of the bond issuing community. In our own analysis over multiple years of each week's
bond ofgferings to the market and the Preliminary Official Statements from issuers that accompany them, we saw
case after case where the financial remnants of floods and hurricanes could be seen, and where impacts on
population size and property - two of the critical indicators for revenues for the bond issuers - where apparent.

Across the key acute perils, rebuilding costs have been underpinned by FEMA DRF funding that has been on an
admitedly bumpy but nonetheless upward trajectory over recent decades. n4 Another key constituent has been
property insurers that help reestablish the property value; the taxes thereon are a key revenue stream from which
debt servicing of municipal general obligation bonds occurs. It is noteworthy, therefore, that in many higher climate
risk states - Florida, Louisiana, California - that major insurers are withdrawing from those markets, n5 and those
that remain are ramping up policy premiums, an outcome that will inevitably lead to a decrease in coverage, and
anecdotally already has. The diminishing of this historically critical pillar of past disaster recovery will only heighten
the post-disaster financial pressure on the municipal (and federal) system. Relatedly, the impact of insurance
coverage and costs flows through to mortgages and even further into the financial system via mortgage-backed
securities (MBS). risQ and Level 11 Analytics were also providing climate risk data to the US fixed income investor
community for agency and non-agency residential MBS debt instruments.

Other perils must also be accounted for which the impacts are more "chronic" in nature: heat, drought and even sea
level rise on water supply in many coastal areas. Heat is a good example to focus on given we just experienced the
hotest year on record globally, with July 2023 the hotest month ever recorded, n6 and cities such as El Paso and
Phoenix shatered records for consecutive days above 100 oF and 110 oF, respectively. n7

This is a critical issue across much of the municipal US, for the health and safety of their served populations and
the municipal workforce, and for municipal infrastructure. Mitigating the impacts of urban heat islanding is an active
effort for many cities including my own hometown of Boston, and no doubt top of mind for the Chief Heat Officers in
the likes of Phoenix, Los Angeles and Miami Dade county. Municipal sectors beyond just cities and counties also
feel this heat. At extreme temperatures, not only are airport personnel at greater risk but aircraft aerodynamics can
be negatively impacted. n8 At least one credit rating agency I am aware of has expressed interest in heat
projections for airports over time.

School districts' exposure to heat risk may be a greater systemic risk, noting that September, the start of the typical
US school year, also set new records in 2023 according to the NOAA. n9 My former colleagues at risQ have
published a comprehensive study focused on this very topic. n10 Temperature has been shown to have a direct
impact on educational performance. n11 In schools without functioning air-conditioning, a 1 oF hoter school year
reduces test scores by 1% of the expected learning gain for that year, and notably on a given day once daytime
heat indexes exceed only 80 oF. By some estimates, around $40 billion of new air conditioning installation is
required across US K-12 schools to address this. n12 As an example of the gap that exists, when the Department
of Energy awarded the first tranche of grants through its Renew America's Schools program in 2023, over 1,000
concept papers, totaling nearly $5.5 billion in requests were received. n13 Close to 90% of selected proposals
included HVAC upgrades. In one such case, a $2 million grant to Natick School District augmented $627K of its
own funding. n14

As always, funding represents a botleneck and catalyst. Improved access to debt is one critical path to explore. As
of January 1, 2024, K-12 public school districts represent around 15% of the total municipal bond market. n15

                                                                                                 Page 3 of 5
  Senate Budget Committee Hearing "Investing in the Future: Safeguarding Municipal Bonds from Climate Risk."
                             Testimony by Chris Hartshorn, Advisor, Zeus AI

Access to debt has been shown to improve K-12 educational outcomes in general, n11 but there is now potentially
a climate-driven educational performance imperative to add to this funding vs outcome mix.

There are already proven mechanisms for lowering the cost of such debt: school districts in states without credit
enhancement programs could have saved between $383 million and $1 billion in debt service payments from 2009
to 2019 if their states had enhancement programs. n16 It is noteworthy that states with such enhancement
programs very rarely experience negative fiscal side-effects of doing so. Such credit enhancement mechanisms
also have current precedent at the federal level for charter schools, another sector within the municipal bond issuer
universe.

In reality, any combination of a given climate peril and a given sector within the municipal universe can be explored
for underlying materiality, but the themes of climate risk, trajectory of risk and cost implications would remain. More
broadly, and critically, mitigation funding can save the nation $6 in future disaster costs, for every $1 spent on
hazard mitigation. n17 That 6x multiple needs to be seen in the context the American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE) estimate that the infrastructure deficit in the US is around $2.59 trillion over the next 10 years, or about
$259 billion per year. n18 The question is how to maximize those upfront dollars for an adaptive and resilient
municipal sector versus continuing to spend a multitude more on post-event recovery and where dollars for doing
so are increasingly stretched.

This, of course, sets aside a still broader question of how the different sectors and jurisdictions within the municipal
bond issuing community - with all their regiospecific idiosyncrasies - prepare for and participate in a transition away
from fossil fuels, the need for which was unanimously agreed to at COP28 in December 2023. n19 Commercial
buildings are responsible for approximately 17% of the total energy consumed in the US. n20 Local government
alone represents more than 10% of total commercial building ownership across the country, and state government
adds a further 1/3 to this number. n21 These amounts exclude significant building occupying sectors also operating
within the municipal bond issuing universe. Transporta.on represents 37% of the total energy consumed in the US,
n22 a number in which municipal bond issuing influence is clear via mass transit availability and fleets, road
infrastructure and investment, zoning decisions (that influence urban density vs sprawl), and broader issues of
urban design and use. In this regard, high resolution geospatial data is now available to city planning and project
siting decision makers to optimize any given decarbonization strategy. n23 There is also obvious interaction to be
found between physical climate risk, carbon transition, housing affordability in decisions within municipal purview.
n24 It is also important to remember that utilities themselves represent a non-trivial sector of debt issuance within
the municipal bond market. n25 Finally, local governments also need to consider the potential impacts of any given
carbon transition path on their own revenue streams and local economies, a topic we initially explored at risQ and
put in the context of potential financial risk. n26

This does not need to be a monolithic draw on the federal purse. The municipal bond market has held steady at
$3.8-$4.1 trillion over the last 15 years, n27 but that apparent stasis is misleading. There is willing capital just siting
on the sidelines. In the multitude of municipal bond conferences I - and colleagues - have atended, and
conversations with many more clients also show, there is more demand for municipal bonds than there is supply.
Prospective municipal debt issuers are often reluctant to take on more debt to address these infrastructure needs,
often driven by the perception that they might get penalized by credit rating agencies for being over leveraged - but
so many, almost all, large metros in good standing could still borrow money at a AAA interest rate and meet the
investment grade requirements of a large swath of the municipal bond investor market. This is without the extra fuel
of aforementioned enhancement programs or relevant support mechanisms such as the The Clean Water State
Revolving Fund or the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program.

Again, thank you for the opportunity to address the critical issue of climate and municipals. I look forward to
addressing any questions the commitee may have.
