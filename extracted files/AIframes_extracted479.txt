Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL) ("Planet" or the "Company"), a leading provider of daily data and insights about Earth,
today announced financial results for the period ended April 30, 2024.

"Planet delivered a solid quarter to start the year. Growth was driven by the government sector where we are
seeing increased demand for our data, particularly when enhanced by AI-based partner solutions. We also
launched the Planet Insights Platform to empower an ecosystem of customers and partners to easily access and
build new solutions with our data," said Will Marshall, Planet's Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and
Chairperson. "Additionally, we're pleased to announce that the National Reconnaissance Office has renewed their
contract with Planet under the EOCL award. We're proud to continue to serve the U.S. government with this
renewal."

Ashley Johnson, Planet's President and Chief Financial Officer, added, "We continue to make progress towards our
target of achieving Adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q4 of this fiscal year - an important milestone on our journey to
building a high margin, sustainable, cash flow generating business. Our balance sheet remains strong with
approximately $276 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of the end of the quarter, and
we continue to have no debt."

        response, amongst other applications. Under the contract, the Agency will also have access to daily data
        that can help in situational awareness in the event of disasters like the recent flooding in the country.
   •    Eletrobras: Planet, through their partner SCCON, signed a three-year contract with Brazilian utilities
        company Eletrobras. Eletrobras is a new customer for Planet, and they will leverage Planet data and
        SCCON alert systems to monitor reservoirs and transmission lines impacted by environmental change and
        irregular occupations.

New Technologies and Products
   •    Planet Insights Platform: Planet recently launched the Planet Insights Platform to fuel an ecosystem of
        partners and customers to easily build solutions and deliver Earth insights. Combining Planet's analysis-
        ready Earth data products with cloud-based analytics and tools allows users to efficiently analyze, stream,

        Planet's imaging capabilities in the spectral domain to complement existing imaging capabilities in the
        temporal and spatial domains.

Impact and ESG

                                                                                                    Page 3 of 11

    •   Second Annual ESG Report: Planet released its second annual ESG Report, which can be found at
        planet.com/esg. It includes information on Planet's ESG programs, and furthermore, highlights the use of
        Planet's data by customers and business partners. In the report, Planet estimates that approximately 50%
        of Planet customers as of January 31st, 2024, have impact use cases, including environmental, social, and
        humanitarian applications. Planet is proud to support the impact of customers and partners around the
        world with its powerful global data set.

Second Quarter Financial Outlook

For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending July 31, 2024, Planet expects revenue to be in the range of
approximately $59 million to $63 million. Non-GAAP Gross Margin is expected to be in the range of approximately
51% to 53%. Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of approximately ($10) million and ($7) million for
the quarter. Capital Expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately $14 million and $17 million for
the quarter.

Planet has not reconciled its Non-GAAP financial outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because
certain reconciling items, such as stock-based compensation expenses and depreciation and amortization are
uncertain or out of Planet's control and cannot be reasonably predicted. The actual amount of these expenses
during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 will have a significant impact on Planet's future GAAP financial
results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of Planet's Non-GAAP outlook to the most comparable GAAP measures is not
available without unreasonable efforts.

The foregoing forward-looking statements reflect Planet's expectations as of today's date. Given the number of risk
factors, uncertainties, and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially.

Webcast and Conference Call Information

Planet will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT today, June 6, 2024. The webcast can be

Planet's Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, certain Non-GAAP Expenses
described further below, Non-GAAP Loss from Operations, Non-GAAP Net Loss, Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted
Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Backlog, which are non-GAAP measures the Company uses to supplement its results
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company includes these non-GAAP financial measures because
they are used by management to evaluate the Company's core operating performance and trends and to make
strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments.

                                                                                                    Page 4 of 11
   Planet Reports Financial Results for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Delivers Record Quarterly Revenue of
                            $60.4 Million, up 15% Year-over-Year Launches Planet....

Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Gross
Profit as gross profit adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets classified
as cost of revenue, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise
business combination. The Company defines Non-GAAP Gross Margin as Non-GAAP Gross Profit divided by
revenue.

Non-GAAP Expenses: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP cost of revenue, Non-GAAP research and
development expenses, Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, and Non-GAAP general and administrative
expenses as, in each case, the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measure (cost of revenue, research and
development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses) adjusted for
stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and employee
transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination, that are classified within each of the
corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP Loss from Operations: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Loss from Operations as loss
from operations adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring
costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination.

Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP
Net Loss as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets,
restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination, and
the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments. The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Net Loss
per Diluted Share as Non-GAAP Net Loss divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Adjusted EBITDA: The Company defines and calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before the impact of
interest income and expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the
following items: stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, non-operating income and
expenses such as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses
in connection with the Sinergise business combination.

The Company presents Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, certain Non-GAAP Expenses described
above, Non-GAAP Loss from Operations, Non-GAAP Net Loss, Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share and
Adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and
other interested parties to evaluate companies in Planet's industry and facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis
across reporting periods. Further, the Company believes these measures are helpful in highlighting trends in its
operating results because they exclude items that are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance.

Backlog: The Company defines and calculates Backlog as remaining performance obligations plus the cancellable
portion of the contract value for contracts that provide the customer with a right to terminate for convenience without
incurring a substantive termination penalty and written orders where funding has not been appropriated. Backlog
does not include unexercised contract options. Remaining performance obligations represent the amount of
contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes both deferred revenue and non-
cancelable contracted revenue that will be invoiced and recognized in revenue in future periods. Remaining
performance obligations do not include contracts which provide the customer with a right to terminate for
convenience without incurring a substantive termination penalty, written orders where funding has not been
appropriated and unexercised contract options.

An increasing and meaningful portion of the Company's revenue is generated from contracts with the U.S.
government and other government customers. Cancellation provisions, such as termination for convenience
clauses, are common in contracts with the U.S. government and certain other government customers. The
Company presents Backlog because the portion of its customer contracts with such cancellation provisions
represents a meaningful amount of the Company's expected future revenues. Management uses backlog to more
effectively forecast the Company's future business and results, which supports decisions around capital allocation.
It also helps the Company identify future growth or operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. The

                                                                                                    Page 5 of 11
   Planet Reports Financial Results for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Delivers Record Quarterly Revenue of
                            $60.4 Million, up 15% Year-over-Year Launches Planet....

Company also believes Backlog is useful for investors in forecasting the Company's future results and
understanding the growth of its business. Customer cancellation provisions relating to termination for convenience
clauses and funding appropriation requirements are outside of the Company's control, and as a result, the
Company may fail to realize the full value of such contracts.

Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, as
a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
non-GAAP financial measures presented are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S.
GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies, which may
have different definitions from the Company's. Further, certain of the non-GAAP financial measures presented
exclude stock-based compensation expenses, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable
future, a significant recurring expense for the Company and an important part of its compensation strategy.

Other Key Metrics

ACV and EoP ACV Book of Business: In connection with the calculation of several of the key operational and
business metrics we utilize, the Company calculates Annual Contract Value ("ACV") for contracts of one year or
greater as the total amount of value that a customer has contracted to pay for the most recent 12 month period for
the contract, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. For short-term
contracts (contracts less than 12 months), ACV is equal to total contract value.

The Company also calculates EoP ACV Book of Business in connection with the calculation of several of the key
operational and business metrics we utilize. The Company defines EoP ACV Book of Business as the sum of the
ACV of all contracts that are active on the last day of the period pursuant to the effective dates and end dates of
such contracts, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. Active contracts
exclude any contract that has been canceled, expired prior to the last day of the period without renewing, or for any
other reason is not expected to generate revenue in the subsequent period. For contracts ending on the last day of
the period, the ACV is either updated to reflect the ACV of the renewed contract or, if the contract has not yet
renewed or extended, the ACV is excluded from the EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company does not annualize
short-term contracts in calculating its EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company calculates the ACV of usage-
based contracts based on the committed contracted revenue or the revenue achieved on the usage-based contract
in the prior 12-month period.

Percent of Recurring ACV: Percent of Recurring ACV is the portion of the total EoP ACV Book of Business that is
recurring in nature. The Company defines EoP ACV Book of Business as the sum of the ACV of all contracts that
are active on the last day of the period pursuant to the effective dates and end dates of such contracts, excluding
customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. The Company defines Percent of Recurring
ACV as the dollar value of all data subscription contracts and the committed portion of usage-based contracts
(excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users) divided by the total dollar value of
all contracts in our EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company believes Percent of Recurring ACV is useful to
investors to better understand how much of the Company's revenue is from customers that have the potential to
renew their contracts over multiple years rather than being one-time in nature. The Company tracks Percent of
Recurring ACV to inform estimates for the future revenue growth potential of our business and improve the
predictability of our financial results. There are no significant estimates underlying management's calculation of
Percent of Recurring ACV, but management applies judgment as to which customers have an active contract at a
period end for the purpose of determining EoP ACV Book of Business, which is used as part of the calculation of
Percent of Recurring ACV.

EoP Customer Count: The Company defines EoP Customer Count as the total count of all existing customers at the
end of the period excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. For EoP
Customer Count, the Company defines existing customers as customers with an active contract with the Company
at the end of the reported period. For the purpose of this metric, the Company defines a customer as a distinct
entity that uses the Company's data or services. The Company sells directly to customers, as well as indirectly

                                                                                                    Page 6 of 11

through its partner network. If a partner does not provide the end customer's name, then the partner is reported as
the customer. Each customer, regardless of the number of active opportunities with the Company, is counted only
once. For example, if a customer utilizes multiple products of Planet, the Company only counts that customer once
for purposes of EoP Customer Count. A customer with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries are also
counted as a single unique customer based on the parent organization or parent account. For EoP Customer
Count, the Company does not include users that only utilize the Company's self-service Sentinel Hub web based
ordering system, which the Company acquired in August 2023, and which offers standard starter packages on a
monthly or annual basis. The Company believes excluding these users from EoP Customer Count creates a more
useful metric, as the Company views the Sentinel Hub starter packages as entry points for smaller accounts,
leading to broader awareness of the Company's solutions throughout their networks and organizations. The
Company believes EoP Customer Count is a useful metric for investors and management to track as it is an
important indicator of the broader adoption of the Company's platform and is a measure of the Company's success
in growing its market presence and penetration. Management applies judgment as to which customers are deemed
to have an active contract in a period, as well as whether a customer is a distinct entity that uses the Company's
data or services.

Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue: The Company defines capital expenditures as purchases of
property and equipment plus capitalized internally developed software development costs, which are included in our
statements of cash flows from investing activities. The Company defines Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of
Revenue as the total amount of capital expenditures divided by total revenue in the reported period. Capital
Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue is a performance measure that we use to evaluate the appropriate level
of capital expenditures needed to support demand for the Company's data services and related revenue, and to
provide a comparable view of the Company's performance relative to other earth observation companies, which
may invest significantly greater amounts in their satellites to deliver their data to customers. The Company uses an
agile space systems strategy, which means we invest in a larger number of significantly lower cost satellites and
software infrastructure to automate the management of the satellites and to deliver the Company's data to clients.
As a result of the Company's strategy and business model, the Company's capital expenditures may be more
similar to software companies with large data center infrastructure costs. Therefore, the Company believes it is
important to look at the level of capital expenditure investments relative to revenue when evaluating the Company's
performance relative to other earth observation companies or to other software and data companies with significant
data center infrastructure investment requirements. The Company believes Capital Expenditures as a Percentage
of Revenue is a useful metric for investors because it provides visibility to the level of capital expenditures required
to operate the Company and the Company's relative capital efficiency.
