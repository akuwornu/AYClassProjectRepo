"We had a solid 2023 and delivered Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA results in line with the expectations discussed
at our Investor Day in September," said David Wilkinson, NCR Voyix CEO. "We have continued to find innovative
solutions to meet the evolving business needs of our install-base of mid-market and enterprise customers. This has

takeaways, and we look forward to continuing this momentum as we move through 2024."

focused on productivity and efficiencies across our organization to drive both margin expansion and free cash flow.
These outcomes will enable us to invest in our growth initiatives and make progress on reducing leverage."

Financial Outlook

The Company is providing fiscal year 2024 guidance as follows:
                                                                              Full Year
        Total Revenue                                                         $3,600M - $3,700M
        Software & Services Revenue                                           $2,700M - $2,750M
        Hardware Revenue                                                      $900M - 950M
        Adjusted EBITDA                                                       $632M - $657M
        Free Cash Flow                                                        $155M - $185M

In this release, we use certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures include "Adjusted EBITDA," and
others with the words "non-GAAP" in their titles. These non-GAAP measures are listed, described and reconciled to
their most directly comparable GAAP measures under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" later in this
release. As further discussed under the heading "Additional Information - Spin-Off Information" our Adjusted
EBITDA for historic periods after giving effect to the spin-off includes certain costs historically allocated to NCR
Atleos that do not meet the definition of expenses related to discontinued operations for purposes of GAAP
requirements regarding the reporting of discontinued operations. Accordingly, our guidance for Adjusted EBITDA in
2024 is more comparable to our historical Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, which includes an adjustment for these
estimated costs.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Spin-Off Information. On October 16, 2023, NCR Voyix completed the spin-off of NCR Atleos as an independent,
publicly traded company. The historical financial results of NCR Atleos are reflected as discontinued operations in
NCR Voyix's consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the spin-off. Accordingly, the
financial information included in this release has been recast to reflect the treatment of NCR Atleos as discontinued
operations. However, certain costs historically allocated to NCR Atleos do not meet the definition of expenses
related to discontinued operations for purposes of GAAP requirements regarding the reporting of discontinued
operations. These estimated costs have been included in NCR Voyix's results from continuing operations, even
though NCR Voyix is not expected to incur any additional amounts with respect to such costs following completion
of the spin-off, and primarily include costs of services and selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result,
NCR Voyix's GAAP and non-GAAP combined segment and consolidated results in this release may not be
comparable with estimates previously reported. To address this, NCR Voyix has provided Normalized Adjusted
EBITDA, which adjusts for these costs.

In addition, NCR Voyix was not able to transfer all NCR Atleos-related operations in all foreign countries
simultaneously with the spin-off. As a result, some of these transfers occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2023 and the first quarter of fiscal 2024, with more expected to occur in the future. Each of these transfers from
continuing operations will impact NCR Voyix's segment and consolidated results as we retrospectively recast
historical financial information for additional operations that become categorized as discontinued operations. As a
result, NCR Voyix's GAAP and non-GAAP combined segment and consolidated results in this release and in future
public disclosures may not be comparable with estimates previously reported.

As a result of discontinued operations treatment and post-2023 transfers and planned transfers of NCR Atleos-
related operations in foreign countries. NCR Voyix's GAAP and non-GAAP combined segment results, segment
results and consolidated results in this release may not be comparable with estimates previously reported. To

                                                                                                           Page 4 of 11
                     NCR Voyix Reports Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results

provide enhanced comparability of combined segment results and consolidated results between periods, NCR
Voyix has provided Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, which adjusts for these items.

Revision. In early February 2024, the Company identified fraudulent automated clearing house "ACH"
disbursements from a company bank account. The cumulative amount of these disbursements through the end of
2023 totaled approximately $23 million, of which approximately $10.5 million were not correctly recorded in certain
of our historic financial statements through September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company expects to record up to
an additional approximately $5 million for unauthorized disbursements, net of amounts remitted back from
suspended accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We intend to cooperate with law enforcement and our banks
to attempt to recover a portion of the fraudulent transfers and to file insurance claims for the remainder. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recovering any of the unauthorized ACH disbursements
from the wrongdoers, our banks or our insurance providers. We evaluated the out-of-period impacts of the error
related to unauthorized ACH disbursements and concluded it was not material to any previously issued quarterly or
annual consolidated financial statements, but because the error is material in the fourth quarter of 2023 (the period
of correction), due to presentation of discontinued operations for the spin-off as discussed above, we have revised
our 2023 quarterly results to include the amount of the ACH disbursements in the quarters when they occurred. The
financial information included in this release reflects the revision. We also identified material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting related to the unauthorized ACH disbursements. Because we are in the
process of validating initial investigative findings related to these fraudulent disbursements and finalizing the impact
on previously issued financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting, as well as completing
certain processes and procedures as a result of the spin-off, have filed an extension for the filing of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND 10-K EXTENSION

As noted above, due to discovery of fraudulent ACH disbursements from a company bank account and the
completion of additional processes and procedures as a result of the spin-off, we are in the process of completing
our financial statements and other disclosures, as well as assessing matters relating to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting and determining the steps necessary to remediate the material weaknesses
related to the unauthorized ACH disbursements. As a result, we will file an extension for the filing of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we are announcing preliminary results
for the year, which are based on currently available information and are subject to revision as management
completes its internal review, and excludes the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash
flows. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not finalized its review of these preliminary financial
results or its audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Actual results may differ from
these preliminary financial results and other financial information due to the completion of our internal procedures,
the audit of our financial statements, final adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the
time the results are finalized. Further disclosure is included in the Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We expect to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023
by March 15, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP Financial Measures. While the Company reports its results in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States, or GAAP, in this release the Company also uses the non-GAAP
measures listed and described below.

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA). The Company
determines Adjusted EBITDA for a given period based on its GAAP net income from continuing operations
attributable to NCR Voyix plus interest expense, net; plus income tax expense (benefit); plus depreciation and
amortization (excluding acquisition-related amortization of intangibles); plus stock-based compensation expense;
plus other income (expense); plus pension mark-to-market adjustments and other special items, including
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, separation-related costs, cyber ransomware incident recovery costs
(net of insurance recoveries), fraudulent ACH disbursements costs, and transformation and restructuring charges
(which includes integration, severance and other exit and disposal costs), among others. Separation-related costs
include costs incurred as a result of the spin-off. Professional and other fees to effect the spin-off including
separation management, organizational design, and legal fees have been classified within discontinued operations
through October 16, 2023, the separation date. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage and measure the
performance of its business segments. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage and determine the
effectiveness of its business managers and as a basis for incentive compensation. The Company believes that
Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance
of the Company's ongoing business operations, including its ability to fund discretionary spending such as capital
expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other investments.

Normalized Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Normalized Adjusted
EBITDA). The Company determines Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for a given period by further adjusting its
Adjusted EBITDA for estimated costs historically allocated to NCR Atleos that do not meet the definition of
expenses related to discontinued operations for purposes of GAAP requirements regarding the reporting of
discontinued operations. Normalized Adjusted EBITDA also removes revenue and costs associated with the
transfer or pending transfer of NCR Atleos-related operations in all foreign countries that have not occurred by
December 31, 2023 from Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for all divestitures
that occurred in prior periods that are not treated as discontinued operations under GAAP. The Company uses
Normalized Adjusted EBITDA to estimate the performance of the continuing business following the spin-off. The
Company believes that Normalized Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it is an
indicator of the strength and performance of the Company's ongoing business operations following the spin-off and
allow for more easy comparisons period over period.

The Company's definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures
reported by other companies and cannot, therefore, be compared with similarly-titled measures of other companies.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in
accordance with GAAP. With respect to our outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we are not

providing a reconciliation to GAAP net income because we are not able to predict with reasonable certainty the
reconciling items that may affect the GAAP net income from continuing operations without unreasonable effort. The
reconciling items are primarily the future impact of special tax items, capital structure transactions, restructuring,
pension mark-to-market transactions, acquisitions and divestitures, or other events. These reconciling items are
uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, GAAP
net income.
