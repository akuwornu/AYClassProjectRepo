Body

The Hartford (NYSE: HIG) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.

"The Hartford's second quarter 2024 financial results were outstanding with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE
of 17.4 percent," said The Hartford's Chairman and CEO Christopher Swift. "Commercial Lines maintained robust
top-line growth at highly profitable margins. Personal Lines continues to make great strides towards restoring target
profitability in auto and Group Benefits achieved a stellar 10 percent core earnings margin during the quarter."

The Hartford's Chief Financial Officer Beth Costello said, "Commercial Lines had an exceptional quarter with an
underlying combined ratio of 87.4. Pricing, excluding workers' compensation, accelerated to 9.5 percent in the
quarter and remains above loss cost trends. Personal Lines achieved written price increases in auto of nearly 24
percent and Group Benefits continued to outperform with record core earnings, driven by strong performance in life
and disability."

Swift continued, "The excellent financial performance in the first half of 2024 reflects the effectiveness of our
strategy and on-going investments to differentiate The Hartford in the marketplace. With continued strong capital
generation from our businesses, we are pleased to announce a new share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billion. I
remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise while enhancing shareholder value with an industry-
leading ROE."

        core earnings, respectively; for net income ROE, the denominator is common stockholders' equity including AOCI;

Second quarter 2024 net income available to common stockholders of $733 million, or $2.44 per diluted share,
improved from $542 million in second quarter 2023, primarily due to a higher P&C underwriting gain, higher net
investment income, and an improvement in the Group Benefits loss ratio, driven by group life results. Included in
the second quarter 2024 net income was a benefit of $37 million, before tax, from amortization of a deferred gain on
retroactive reinsurance related to an adverse development cover for Navigators pertaining to 2018 and prior
accident years (Navigator's ADC).

Second quarter 2024 core earnings of $750 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, compared with $588 million of core
earnings in second quarter 2023. Contributing to the results were:
    •      An increase in earnings generated by 9% growth in P&C earned premium.
    •      Net favorable prior accident year development (PYD) in core earnings of $78 million, before tax, in 2024
           compared with net favorable PYD of $39 million in core earnings in 2023. Net favorable PYD in second
           quarter 2024 primarily included reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, personal lines,
           and bond, partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance, and commercial
           auto liability.
    •      Commercial Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 58.4 improved 1.3 points compared with 59.7
           in second quarter 2023, including 1.3 points of more favorable PYD and 0.7 points of higher CATs.
           Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio* of 56.1 compared with 56.8 in second quarter 2023,
           with the improvement largely due to lower non-CAT property losses.
    •      Personal Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 81.0 improved 8.2 points compared with 89.2 in
           second quarter 2023, including 3.6 points of more favorable PYD and 1.1 points of higher CATs.
           Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 70.3 compared with 76.1 in second quarter 2023,
           with the improvement largely due to the impact of earned pricing increases, partially offset by an increase
           in severity in auto and homeowners as expected.
    •      P&C CAY CAT losses of $280 million, before tax, in second quarter 2024, compared with CAY CAT losses
           of $226 million in second quarter 2023.

                                                                                             Page 3 of 20

    •      Group Benefits loss ratio of 68.9 improved 3.2 points compared with 72.1 due to lower claim severity in
           group life, lower long-term disability claim incidence and a higher New York paid family leave risk
           adjustment benefit, partially offset by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products.
    •      Net investment income of $602 million, before tax, compared with $540 million in second quarter 2023,
           primarily driven by higher invested assets and higher yields on our fixed income portfolio.

June 30, 2024, book value per diluted share of $51.43 increased 4.0%, from $49.43 at Dec. 31, 2023, principally
due to net income in excess of stockholder dividends through June 30, 2024, partially offset by the dilutive effect of
share repurchases and greater net unrealized losses on investments within AOCI driven by higher interest rates.

Book value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) of $61.71 as of June 30, 2024, increased 4.9%, from $58.83 at Dec.
31, 2023, as the impact from net income in excess of stockholder dividends through June 30, 2024, was partially
offset by the dilutive effect of share repurchases.

Net income available to common stockholders' ROE (net income ROE) for the 12-month period ending June 30,
2024, was 19.8%, an increase of 5.4 points from second quarter 2023, primarily due to an increase in 12-month
trailing net income available to common stockholders, and an increase in average net unrealized losses on
investments in AOCI.

Core earnings ROE for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, was 17.4%, an increase of 3.8 points from
second quarter 2023 due to higher trailing 12-month core earnings.

Second quarter 2024 net income of $540 million compared with net income of $458 million in second quarter 2023,
principally due to the impact of earned premium growth, more favorable PYD, higher net investment income, and an

includes a $37 million, before-tax, benefit due to the amortization of the deferred gain related to the Navigators

Commercial Lines core earnings of $551 million in second quarter 2024 compared with $493 million in second
quarter 2023. Contributing to the results were:
    •    8% growth in earned premium.
    •    Net investment income of $402 million, before tax, compared with $364 million in second quarter 2023.
    •    An underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 56.1, in second quarter 2024 compared with 56.8
         in second quarter 2023, with the improvement primarily driven by lower non-CAT property losses.
    •    Net favorable PYD within core earnings of $44 million, before tax, in second quarter 2024, compared with
         $38 million of net favorable PYD within core earnings in second quarter 2023. The net favorable PYD in
         second quarter 2024 primarily includes reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, and
         bond, partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance, and auto liability.
    •    CAY CAT losses of $155 million, before tax, in second quarter 2024, primarily from tornado, wind and hail
         events across several regions of the United States, but concentrated in the South and Midwest, up from
         CAY CAT losses of $123 million in second quarter 2023.

Combined ratio of 89.8 in second quarter 2024, improved from 91.2 in second quarter 2023, primarily due to a 1.3
point improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, including 1.3 points of more favorable PYD
(including 1.2 points of favorable development related to the amortization of the deferred gain) partially offset by 0.7
points of higher CAY CAT losses. Underlying combined ratio of 87.4 improved from 88.3 in second quarter 2023
primarily due to a 0.7 point decrease in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio.
    •    Small Commercial combined ratio of 88.7 improved from 90.8 in second quarter 2023, including 0.3 points
         of less favorable PYD and 0.4 points of higher CAY CATs. Underlying combined ratio of 86.8 compared
         with 89.7 in second quarter 2023 primarily due to lower non-CAT property losses.
    •    Middle & Large Commercial combined ratio of 95.9 compared with 93.6 in second quarter 2023, driven by
         1.0 points of higher CAY CATs and 0.3 points of more unfavorable PYD. Underlying combined ratio of 89.6
         compared with 88.7 in second quarter 2023, primarily due to higher non-CAT property losses compared
         with a favorable non-CAT experience in the prior year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio.
    •    Global Specialty combined ratio of 83.4 compared with 87.3 in second quarter 2023, driven by 5.0 points of
         more favorable PYD, partially offset by 0.9 points of higher CAY CATs. The combined ratio included 4.4
         points of favorable development due to the amortization of the deferred gain related to the Navigators
         ADC. Underlying combined ratio of 85.2 compared with 85.0 in second quarter 2023.

Second quarter 2024 written premiums of $3.5 billion were up 11% from second quarter 2023, with increases
across the segment, strong double-digit new business growth in Small Commercial and Middle Market, and the
effect of renewal written price increases.

Net loss of $11 million in second quarter 2024 improved from a net loss of $60 million in second quarter 2023,
driven by improved underwriting results and an increase in net investment income. Contributing to the improved
underwriting results was the impact of higher earned premium and a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
of 81.0 compared with 89.2 in second quarter 2023.

Personal Lines core loss of $4 million improved from a core loss of $57 million in second quarter 2023. Contributing
to the results were:

    •    An underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 70.3 in second quarter 2024 improved from 76.1

         increase in severity in auto and homeowners as expected.
    •    $34 million, before tax, of favorable PYD in second quarter of 2024, compared with $3 million favorable
         PYD in second quarter 2023. The net favorable PYD in second quarter 2024 is driven by reserve
         reductions in auto liability related to property damage, homeowners and auto physical damage.
    •    Net investment income of $50 million, before tax, in second quarter 2024 compared with $34 million in
         second quarter 2023.
    •    CAY CAT losses of $125 million, before tax, in second quarter 2024, primarily from tornado, wind and hail
         events across several regions of the United States, but concentrated in the South and Midwest, up from
         $103 million of CAY CAT losses in second quarter 2023.

Combined ratio of 107.4 in second quarter 2024, improved from 114.9 in second quarter 2023, primarily due to an
8.2 point improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, including 3.6 points of more favorable PYD
and a 5.8 point improvement in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, partially offset by 1.1 points
of higher CAY CAT losses. Underlying combined ratio of 96.7 improved from 101.7 in second quarter 2023,
primarily due to improvement in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in auto and homeowners,
partially offset by a 0.7 point increase in the expense ratio, largely driven by higher marketing expenses.
    •    Auto combined ratio of 105.4 improved from 116.4 in second quarter 2023. The underlying combined ratio
         of 104.9 improved from 111.8 in second quarter 2023, primarily due to the impact of double-digit earned
         pricing increases, partially offset by higher marketing expenses and an increase in auto liability and
         physical damage claim severity as expected.
    •    Homeowners combined ratio of 114.5 improved from 115.1 in second quarter 2023. The underlying
         combined ratio of 77.8 improved from 79.6 in second quarter 2023, primarily due to the impact of double-
         digit earned pricing and favorable weather and non-weather frequency, partially offset by higher marketing
         expenses and elevated weather and non-weather severity.

Written premiums in second quarter 2024 were $913 million compared with $802 million in second quarter 2023
with:
    •    Renewal written price increases in auto and homeowners of 23.5% and 14.9%, respectively, in response to
         elevated loss cost trends.
    •    An increase in new business in both auto and homeowners from second quarter 2023 of $30 million, or
         58%, and $25 million, or 114%, respectively.
    •    Lower effective policy count retention, driven by auto, due to renewal written price increases.

Net income of $171 million in second quarter 2024 increased from $121 million in second quarter 2023, largely
driven by improvement in the group life loss ratio. Core earnings were $178 million, up from $133 million in second
quarter 2023, consistent with the growth in net income.

Fully insured ongoing premiums were up 2% compared with second quarter 2023, including an increase in
exposure on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90%, though slightly below the
prior year period. Fully insured ongoing sales were $101 million in second quarter 2024, compared with $151 million
in second quarter 2023, driven by lower group disability and group life sales.

Loss ratio of 68.9 improved from 72.1 in second quarter 2023.
    •    Group life loss ratio of 74.9 improved 9.2 points largely driven by lower claim severity experience.
    •    Group disability loss ratio of 67.1 was essentially flat with second quarter 2023, driven by lower long-term
         disability claim incidence and a higher New York paid family leave risk adjustment benefit, offset primarily
         by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products.

Net investment income of $112 million, before tax, compared with $113 million in second quarter 2023.

Second quarter 2024 consolidated net investment income of $602 million compared with $540 million in second
quarter 2023, primarily due to a higher level of invested assets, the impact of reinvesting at higher rates, and a
higher yield on variable-rate securities, partially offset by lower income from limited partnerships and other
alternative investments (LPs).

Second quarter 2024 included $16 million, before tax, of LP income as compared with $32 million in second quarter
2023. Annualized LP yield, before tax, of 1.3% compared to 2.9% in second quarter 2023. Lower LP income was
primarily driven by lower returns on real estate joint ventures.

Net realized losses of $59 million, before tax, in second quarter 2024 compared with net realized losses of $64
million, before tax, in second quarter 2023.

Total invested assets of $56.9 billion increased $1.0 billion from Dec. 31, 2023, primarily due to a net increase in
book value, partially offset by lower valuations on fixed maturities driven by an increase in interest rates net of credit
spread tightening.

DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Hartford uses non-GAAP financial measures in this news release to assist investors in analyzing the
company's operating performance for the periods presented herein. Because The Hartford's calculation of these
measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing
The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. Definitions and calculations of other
financial measures used in this news release can be found below and in The Hartford's Investor Financial
Supplement for second quarter 2024, which is available on The Hartford's website, https://ir.thehartford.com .

Annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments - This non-GAAP
measure is calculated as (a) the annualized net investment income, on a Consolidated, P&C or Group Benefits
level, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, divided by (b) the monthly average invested
assets at amortized cost, as applicable, excluding derivatives book value and limited partnerships and other
alternative investments. The Company believes that annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and
other alternative investments, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings
because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative
investments. Annualized investment yield is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the
annualized investment yield to annualized investment yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternatives
investments for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is provided in the table below.

Book value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) - This is a non-GAAP per share measure that is calculated by
dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive
potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the
Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes
that excluding AOCI from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can
fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted

Core earnings - The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the
Company's operating performance. The Hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable
measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and
financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items. Therefore, the
following items are excluded from core earnings:
   •    Certain realized gains and losses - Generally realized gains and losses are primarily driven by investment
        decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the
        insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all
        realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market
        conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized gains and losses are integrally related to
        our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic
        settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting
        item included in the income statement such as net investment income.
   •    Restructuring and other costs - Costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating
        expense of the business.
   •    Loss on extinguishment of debt - Largely consisting of make-whole payments or tender premiums upon
        paying debt off before maturity, these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business.
   •    Gains and losses on reinsurance transactions - Gains or losses on reinsurance, such as those entered into
        upon sale of a business or to reinsure loss reserves, are not a recurring operating expense of the business.
   •    Integration and other non-recurring M&A costs - These costs, including transaction costs incurred in
        connection with an acquired business, are incurred over a short period of time and do not represent an
        ongoing operating expense of the business.
   •    Change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business - These changes in loss reserves are excluded
        from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the
        acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition.
   •    Deferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain -
        Retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and excluding the deferred
        gain on retroactive reinsurance and related amortization of the deferred gain from core earnings provides
        greater insight into the economics of the business.
   •    Change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non-core components of before tax income -
        These changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non-core
        components of before tax income, such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards.

                                                                                            Page 13 of 20

    •    Results of discontinued operations - These results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or
         held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our
         ongoing businesses.

In addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core
earnings, preferred stock dividends declared, which are excluded from net income, are included in the
determination of core earnings. Preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on
debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding.

Net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or
net income (loss) available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's
business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income
(loss) available to common stockholders, and core earnings when reviewing the Company's performance.

A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, is
included in this news release. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for individual reporting
segments can be found in this news release under the heading "The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Consolidating Income Statements" and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the quarter ended June
30, 2024.

Core earnings margin - The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it
is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is
calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income
margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The
Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of
Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and
realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin
should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Group
Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and
net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin for
the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, is set forth below.

Core earnings per diluted share - This non-GAAP per share measure is calculated using the non-GAAP financial
measure core earnings rather than the GAAP measure net income. The Company believes that core earnings per
diluted share provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's operating performance for the same
reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core earnings. Net income (loss) available to common stockholders
per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings per diluted share should
not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share
and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company believes that it is
useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share and
core earnings per diluted share when reviewing the Company's performance. A reconciliation of net income

Core Earnings Return on Equity - The Company provides different measures of the return on stockholders' equity
(ROE). Core earnings ROE is calculated based on non-GAAP financial measures. Core earnings ROE is calculated
by dividing (a) the non-GAAP measure core earnings for the prior four fiscal quarters by (b) the non-GAAP measure
average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI. Net income ROE is the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measure. The Company excludes AOCI in the calculation of core earnings ROE to provide investors with a
measure of how effectively the Company is investing the portion of the Company's net worth that is primarily
attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company provides to investors return on equity measures
based on its non-GAAP core earnings financial measure for the reasons set forth in the core earnings definition. A
quantitative reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders ROE to core earnings ROE is not
calculable on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of realized gains and
losses, which typically vary substantially from period to period.

ROE is set forth below.

Underlying combined ratio- This non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio
before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon
acquisition of a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes
this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and
unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development.
The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because

                                                                                            Page 15 of 20

such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior
to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors' ability to assess the Company's financial
performance. A reconciliation of the combined ratio to the underlying combined ratio for individual reporting

Underwriting gain (loss) - The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines
segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax non-GAAP
measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting
expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced
significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over
time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage
exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of
reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides
investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are
managed separately from the Company's investing activities. A reconciliation of net income to underwriting gain
(loss) for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, is set forth below.

Underlying underwriting gain (loss) - This non-GAAP measure of underwriting profitability represents underwriting
gain (loss) before current accident year catastrophes, PYD and current accident year change in loss reserves upon
acquisition of a business. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The Company
believes underlying underwriting gain (loss) is important to understand the Company's periodic earnings because
the volatile and unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and prior accident year reserve
development could obscure underwriting trends. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are
also excluded from underlying underwriting gain (loss) because such changes could obscure the ability to compare
results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our
investors' ability to assess the Company's financial performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to underlying
underwriting gain (loss) for individual reporting segments for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,
is set forth below.

Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio - This non-GAAP financial measure of the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio for Commercial Lines and Personal Lines represents the loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. The loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is an
important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe
losses and prior accident year reserve development. A reconciliation of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
to the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, is

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

Certain of the statements contained herein are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor

words such as "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "projects," and similar
references to future periods.

Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding future
economic, competitive, legislative and other developments and their potential effect upon The Hartford Financial
Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "The Hartford"). Because forward-looking
statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that
are difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from expectations depending on the evolution of various
factors, including the risks and uncertainties identified below, as well as factors described in such forward-looking
statements; or in The Hartford's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    •   Risks Relating to Economic, Political and Global Market Conditions: challenges related to the Company's
        current operating environment, including global political, economic and market conditions, and the effect of

        barriers or other potentially adverse macroeconomic developments on the demand for our products and
        returns in our investment portfolios; market risks associated with our business, including changes in credit
        spreads, equity prices, interest rates, inflation rate, foreign currency exchange rates and market volatility;

        of the economy; the impacts of changing climate and weather patterns on our businesses, operations and
        investment portfolio including on claims, demand and pricing of our products, the availability and cost of
        reinsurance, our modeling data used to evaluate and manage risks of catastrophes and severe weather
        events, the value of our investment portfolios and credit risk with reinsurers and other counterparties;
    •   Insurance Industry and Product-Related Risks: the possibility of unfavorable loss development, including
        with respect to long-tailed exposures; the significant uncertainties that limit our ability to estimate the
        ultimate reserves necessary for asbestos and environmental claims; the possibility of another pandemic,

                                                                                            Page 19 of 20

         tornadoes, hail, wildfires, flooding, winter storms, hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as climate change
         and its potential impact on weather patterns; the possible occurrence of terrorist attacks and the
         Company's inability to contain its exposure as a result of, among other factors, the inability to exclude
         coverage for terrorist attacks from workers' compensation policies and limitations on reinsurance coverage
         from the federal government under applicable laws; the Company's ability to effectively price its products
         and policies, including its ability to obtain regulatory consents to pricing actions or to non-renewal or
         withdrawal of certain product lines; actions by competitors that may be larger or have greater financial
         resources than we do; technological changes, including usage-based methods of determining premiums,
         advancements in certain emerging technologies, including machine learning, predictive analytics, "big
         data" analysis or other artificial intelligence functions, advancements in automotive safety features, the
         development of autonomous vehicles, and platforms that facilitate ride sharing; the Company's ability to

         future distribution channels and advisory firms; the uncertain effects of emerging claim and coverage
         issues; political instability, politically motivated violence or civil unrest, which may increase the frequency

         interruption property claims and the possibility of a resurgence of COVID-19 related losses in Group
         Benefits;

Financial Strength, Credit and Counterparty Risks: risks to our business, financial position, prospects and results
associated with negative rating actions or downgrades in the Company's financial strength and credit ratings or
negative rating actions or downgrades relating to our investments; capital requirements which are subject to many
factors, including many that are outside the Company's control, such as National Association of Insurance
Commissioners ("NAIC") risk based capital formulas, rating agency capital models, Funds at Lloyd's and Solvency
Capital Requirement, which can in turn affect our credit and financial strength ratings, cost of capital, regulatory
compliance and other aspects of our business and results; losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others,
including credit risk with counterparties associated with investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, reinsurance
recoverables and indemnifications provided by third parties in connection with previous dispositions; the potential
for losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and
the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance to protect the Company against losses; state and international
regulatory limitations on the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends;

Risks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations: risks associated with the use of analytical models in
making decisions in key areas such as underwriting, pricing, capital management, reserving, investments,
reinsurance and catastrophe risk management; the potential for differing interpretations of the methodologies,
estimations and assumptions that underlie the Company's fair value estimates for its investments and the
evaluation of intent-to-sell impairments and allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities and
mortgage loans; the potential for impairments of our goodwill;

Strategic and Operational Risks: the Company's ability to maintain the availability of its systems and safeguard the
security of its data in the event of a disaster, cyber or other information security incident or other unanticipated
event; the potential for difficulties arising from outsourcing and similar third-party relationships; the risks, challenges
and uncertainties associated with capital management plans, expense reduction initiatives and other actions; risks
associated with acquisitions and divestitures, including the challenges of integrating acquired companies or
businesses, which may result in our inability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies and may result in
unintended consequences; difficulty in attracting and retaining talented and qualified personnel, including key
employees, such as executives, managers and employees with strong technological, analytical and other
specialized skills; the Company's ability to protect its intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement;

Regulatory and Legal Risks: the cost and other potential effects of increased federal, state and international
regulatory and legislative developments, including those that could adversely impact the demand for the Company's
products, operating costs and required capital levels; unfavorable judicial or legislative developments; the impact of

                                                                                            Page 20 of 20
