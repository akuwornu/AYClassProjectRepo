Drone Systems and Applications, a peer-reviewed journal that says it features unoccupied vehicle systems, such as
remotely-controlled or autonomous mobile robots, known as drones, that operate in the air, on the ground, or on or
below the water surface, published research articles on the following topics in its 2024 edition (Vol. 12):

Review

* Multi-UAV networks for disaster monitoring: challenges and opportunities from a network perspective

* Review of autonomous outdoor blimps and their applications

* Malicious UAV detection using various modalities

* UAV avionics safety, certification, accidents, redundancy, integrity, and reliability: a comprehensive review and
future trends

* A systematic review on metaheuristic approaches for autonomous path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles

* A methodological approach to rock art survey and recording via drone. The application to the Rock Art of the
Mediterranean Basin of the Iberian Peninsula assemblage

Mini review

* An analysis of trends in UAV swarm implementations in current research: simulation versus hardware

Research Articles
