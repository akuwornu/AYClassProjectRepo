Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-Texas, issued the following news release on March 6, 2024:

Today, Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher (TX-07) voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, H.R. 4366, a
bipartisan government funding bill that funds essential programs, addresses many of the challenges our country
faces, and provides nearly $16 million for fourteen local projects that Congresswoman Fletcher specifically
requested through the Community Funded Projects process. These projects will provide funding for the Harris
County Flood Control District, METRO, Fort Bend County Transit, and the Cities of Houston and Sugar Land,
among others. Congress is expected to consider an additional funding bill in the coming weeks.

"I was pleased to vote today to continue to fund important programs in our government and to bring to our district
nearly $16 million in federal funding," said Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher. "Each of the projects I worked to secure
funding for will make a positive impact in our community - from protecting our community from flooding to
supporting safety and transit improvements to enhancing community centers for seniors and people with disabilities.
These projects touch every corner of our district, and I look forward to working with local leaders and advocates on
these projects once this legislation is signed into law and building on our partnerships to deliver for the people of
Texas' Seventh Congressional District."
