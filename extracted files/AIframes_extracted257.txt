The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency issued the following remarks on July 15, 2024, by Director Vice Adm.
Frank "Trey" Whitworth at the Esri International User Conference Senior Executive Summit entitled "GIS - Uniting
Our World": :

***

Thanks so much for that kind introduction, Jack [Dangermon, Esri President], and for the invitation to speak here at
the Senior Executive Summit this morning, on behalf of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

For those who aren't that familiar with us, NGA is a U.S. Government agency of nearly 15,000 people. We serve as
both a Combat Support Agency in the U.S. Department of Defense, and as one of the six principal agencies in the
U.S. Intelligence Community. About half of us in are in the Washington DC area, a quarter of us are in St. Louis,
Missouri, and a quarter are spread out all over the planet, co-located with military and international partners. Rather
than those organizations reaching back for our expertise, we project our expertise forward.

Our mission is to provide geospatial intelligence - GEOINT for short - to national policy makers, military leaders, and
first responders. And our motto is "Know the World, Show the Way...from Seabed to Space."

Now, from a national security perspective, I could certainly spend my entire time telling you how our agency
accomplishes those mission sets by supporting NATO efforts to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine. Or helping
to unite the world by making sure there's freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and all
international waters. Or creating greater awareness of conflicts around the planet - "from Seabed to Space," as our
motto states. And then sharing that awareness with our allies and partners.

But I'll tell you that at NGA, we've also started to concentrate more on in the areas less traditionally associated with
bread and butter intelligence work, and that's what I'd like to talk to you about today. First: The necessity of
incorporating AI into GEOINT software and workflow processes, because of the deluge of data we face. Second:

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 4

The criticality of our GEOINT tradecraft, to include expertise in the science of Geodesy. And third: Leveraging
Climate Security, to improve our Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief capacity for both warning and
operations.

At a higher level, if we could bring our traditional ethos that's been primarily emphasized Warning, Targeting, and
Safety, and apply it more rigorously than ever before to other areas, such as the prevention of some climate-related
issues, and the ability to solve problems caused by natural disasters, considerably earlier, how could we help
change the world? How could we get ahead of those situations?

Let's start with Geospatial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence - GEOINT AI--and the upcoming "deluge of data" that
the coming years will bring.

With all of the government and commercial satellite programs that will be capable in the next five to ten years,
GEOINT data will at least triple. But there won't be a corresponding growth of people or money - those will be
relatively flat.

So GEOINT AI will be necessary in helping our analysts extract deeper insights and make more informed decisions,
from the massive amounts of geospatial data they collect. The AI/GIS combination is key, because GIS excels at
visualizing and analyzing spatial relationships, and AI can identify complex patterns and correlations within that
spatial context. It thankfully automates tedious, repetitive tasks. And it also builds predictive models for Disaster
Relief situations - like the paths and impact of hurricanes or wildfires, or the spread of disease outbreaks.

AI holds the potential to significantly alter our world - which is both exhilarating and frightening.

Before we can fully understand AI's power to change the future, it's worth looking at a few events that could have
turned out differently with AI.

Think back to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Remember the Russian Army's massive traffic jam north of
Kyiv, that stretched up to 35 miles long? If they had real-time traffic monitoring with AI to assist in routing
adjustments, and AI-generated topographic data to provide alternative movement options, they would have been
more likely to have reached Kyiv. Fortunately in this case, they failed - and they had to retreat.

Back in 2016, Hurricane Matthew hit the Carolinas very hard. FEMA needed detailed assessments of structures,
damage levels, transportation and infrastructure conditions, and areas and extents of flooding, but there was a lot of
cloud cover - not good for getting full imagery. Had we had GEOINT AI at work, the many hours of work to
determine more than 1,300 segments of impassable road, and more than 3,200 areas of flooding, would have been
done in minutes - and FEMA would have been able to respond much faster.

Looking at Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief type missions, what does the near future hold thanks to
GEOINT AI? Well, FEMA now does this quite well with its Modeling & Simulations and with NOAA predictions, but
we're looking at ways we could assist them considerably more, whenever an advancing cyclone or hurricane is
forecasted, and we're formally requested by civil authorities. Together, we can use higher fidelity geospatial,
weather, and previous disaster data to predict how many people will be displaced from their homes, and where
they'll probably move. AI insights can help emergency personnel identify how much food, water, and medical care
will probably be needed, and where to send it. And AI models can instantaneously assess flooding, building, and
road damage - based on satellite images and weather forecasts. FEMA uses more than just satellite images -
airborne, UAVs, and crowd-sourcing, etc. - and the accuracy is quite high, even 90 percent - but it currently takes
humans viewing images to get to 100 percent. But AI allows for quicker and more effective distribution of
emergency aid, and could assist Urban Search and Rescue missions for those still in danger - people who were
isolated from escape routes.

I don't need to tell those of you from here in California, with multiple fires burning throughout the state, that the
same goes for wildfires. The National Interagency Fire Center uses wind and weather data to gage fire locations
and their potential spread, which eventually helps the firefighters who put them out. More predictive analysis, using
AI, could maximize effectiveness.

                                                                                                  Page 3 of 4

All right, let's pivot to another imperative, and talk about all the ongoing changes within and on our planet Earth,
which are the proximate causes for many disasters.

The science dealing with the size and shape of the rock we live on is called Geodesy. It includes the study of the
gravitational field, coordinates, and reference frames. And at NGA, it also includes other foundational geophysical
elements, such as the magnetic field and subsurface modeling. We all learned in school that the mass of the Moon
and the Sun causes the tides on the Earth, and the daily movement of water. The mountains, valleys, crust
thickness, and density changes of our planet cause even larger changes in gravitational fluxes. For navigation
systems, this change of gravity can cause hundreds of feet - or more - in errors. Using 2.7 grams per cubic
centimeter for rock density was good enough for your college physics or geology class - but rock density varies,
based on the rocks, as well as changes over time. So we need precise and accurate numbers - five more decimals
for gravity values for example - to ensure that our gravitational and magnetic systems will operate accurately in
support. These accurate numbers come from performing precise geodetic surveys and measurements everywhere
on this rock.

If you take it a step further, Geodesy also includes measuring the orbits of satellites. And it's essential that the
scientists in this field - geodesists - constantly provide updated geodetic products for satellite operations. Otherwise,
the satellite applications that we now take for granted would degrade or fail. Satellites need new geodetic products
uploaded to them constantly, because the Earth and the satellites are always moving. They're pushed by solar
radiation, and pulled by Earth's gravitational force, which varies over time and location. And when you're nearly
11,000 nautical miles away, moving at 7,000 miles an hour, tiny errors in geolocation become huge errors for users
of the satellite data.

So there are ways that AI can help here, too - with high-precision digital elevation models - aligning them with
topographic data and maps. That eliminates the need for costly and time-intensive stereo extraction. For example,
the height of a building, or the slope of a road, can be calculated directly and programmatically from an overlapping
elevation model.

Now, here's the challenge: We have some terrific geodesists at NGA who work hard on all this. But China has
embraced the Geodesy field to the extent that it now has more Ph.D. geodesists than the rest of the world
combined. Geodesy skills are critical to expertise in our positioning, navigation, and timing missions. They're
essential to such diverse areas as precision missiles, autonomous platforms, next-generation synchronized atomic
clocks, and celestial navigation. They're also embedded into to our way of life - our phones, the GPS systems in our
cars, our banking systems. There's a great quote by the former Chief Scientist of Xerox 's Palo Alto Research
Center from back in the early 1990s: "The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave
themselves into the fabric of everything in life, until they're indistinguishable from it." Being the source for precision
provides a national, technological, and economic advantage. So we all must look for ways to invest more in
Geodesy - with respect to the U.S., our Allies, and our partners.

One final imperative - let's talk about Climate Security.

We're trying more than ever to channel our traditional ethos - which has been mostly associated with warfighting -
into the humanitarian and disaster arena. We're exploring future weather and climate conditions on U.S. and
partner bases, the impacts from sea level rise on coastal bases (plus tides and storms), and the impacts of extreme
heat on flight operations globally. Some of this gets done at the theater and combatant command level, but there's
no reason NGA couldn't provide this as a global service - given our expertise and data holdings.

At the strategic level, using a 24/7 Watch approach could help us to better integrate our tradecraft across the
Human Geography and GEOINT analysis disciplines. Taking that approach could provide more advanced warning
for U.S. border security partners, and a closer look at the impacts of weather-related issues - like how food and
economic security affect migration. We do work on this already, but there are valid arguments that we could do it
more robustly, and take on a leading role in providing GEOINT data and services, to all our partners across the Title
50 and Non-Title 50 Agencies.

                                                                                                 Page 4 of 4
       NGA Director Frank Issues Remarks at Esri International User Conference Senior Executive Summit

One area of concern is sea ice. It's melting, and fast. And because it's melting, it's creating greater access
opportunities to areas in the Arctic - like the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage - which is a cause of
concern for several nations' operational security, not to mention maritime safety hazards for navigation.

So, NGA applied AI to this issue, to deliver ways to better track and map sea ice. We developed the Snowfox
algorithm, through a partnership with the U.S National Ice Center - to automate monitoring Arctic sea ice
characterization, to include extent, concentration, and stage of development - using Synthetic Aperture Radar
imagery. Snowfox now helps our analysts process the huge amounts of data we get from the Sentinel 1 RADAR
satellite constellation by: Capturing hundreds of pan-Arctic Sentinel 1 SAR images daily, applying a Machine-
Learning algorithm, and producing a binary map of white ice and black open water - either "ice" or "no ice." The
output is quick and fast - and about 85 percent accurate - which cuts our time by more than half, and supports
analysts at multiple centers and our mission partners. Our customers include the National Ice Center, the US Navy,
the US Coast Guard, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. And of course, we'll
keep refining Snowfox, with more and greater satellite imagery sources.

To sum it all up, GEOINT AI, Geodesy, and Climate Security are three vital areas where NGA - and by default GIS -
can support global unity by improving our predictions, warnings and responses for Humanitarian Assistance and
Disaster Response.

Overall, I'm quite hopeful for the future, because I so highly respect the GIS and geospatial community. I truly don't
think there's a group of professionals on this planet doing more for this planet or more to unite our world than this
community. And that applies whether we're trying to save the world from bad weather, or protect it from bad actors,
or both.

So together, we're going to continue to build great relationships, and brainstorm about our next great collaborative
projects. And I strongly believe that we'll do that expertly, as we chart the way forward, and keep making impressive
progress together. Thank you very much.
