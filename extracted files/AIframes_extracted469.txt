ExaGrid's breakthrough Tiered Backup Storage provides comprehensive security, ransomware recovery, multiple
disaster recovery options, and more. The solution writes backups directly to a disk-cache Landing Zone, avoiding
inline processing and ensuring the highest level of backup performance, resulting in a short backup window.
Adaptive Deduplication performs deduplication and replication in parallel with backups for a strong recovery point
(RPO). As data is being deduplicated to the Repository Tier, it can also be replicated to a second data center site or
to the public cloud for disaster recovery (DR). ExaGrid offers the only two-tiered backup storage approach with
comprehensive security.

ExaGrid's scale-out architecture includes full appliances and ensures a fixed-length backup window as data grows.
The appliances contain disk, processing power, memory, and bandwidth and additional appliances can be added.
The system scales linearly, maintaining a fixed-length backup window and customers only pay for what they need.
Data is deduplicated into the non-network-facing Repository Tier with automatic load balancing and global
deduplication across all repositories.

Additionally, ExaGrid has recently added three new appliance models to its product line: the EX54, EX84, and
EX189, which offer the largest single scale-out system storage capacity for any backup storage on the market, and
announced that all ExaGrid appliances are available in 2U models, offering rack space efficiency.

                                                                                                Page 2 of 3

"We're grateful for this industry recognition in the 2024 Data Breakthrough Awards program. When we realized that
no vendor was building storage that optimizes backup, we built our Tiered Backup Storage specifically to improve
backup performance, restore performance, and scalability as data grows," said Bill Andrews, President and CEO of
ExaGrid. "The economics of backup are just as important as performance. We're proud to be the largest
independent backup storage vendor and we will continue to innovate our solution with the goal of eliminating all of
the challenges that organizations face when it comes to backups."

The annual Data Breakthrough Awards is the premier awards program founded to recognize the data technology
innovators, leaders and visionaries from around the world in a range of categories, including DataOps, Data
Analytics, AI, Business Intelligence, Data Privacy, Data Storage and many more. The 5th annual Data
Breakthrough Award program attracted thousands of nominations from across the globe.

"ExaGrid Backup Storage delivers fast backup ingest and restore performance, comprehensive security features, a
non-network-facing tier and a scale-out architecture along with industry-leading customer support. Organizations
face an incredible amount of issues when it comes to backup, including deduplication which so often negatively
impacts backup and restore performance," said Steve Johansson, Managing Director, Data Breakthrough.
"ExaGrid's unique architecture, its constant innovation, and its dedication to offering the best backup storage
solution, sets ExaGrid Tiered Backup Storage apart; we're thrilled to award them with our 2024 'Data Backup
Solution of the Year!' designation."
