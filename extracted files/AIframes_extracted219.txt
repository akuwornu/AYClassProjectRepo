"HPE exceeded our profitability expectations and drove near-record year-over-year growth in our recurring revenue
in the face of market headwinds, demonstrating the relevance of our strategy," said Antonio Neri, president and
CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "Despite a mixed quarter, I remain very confident that our focus on customer-
centric innovation and our track record of operational discipline will allow us to capitalize on the significant market
opportunities in AI as well as across edge and hybrid cloud and to deliver value to our shareholders."

"HPE drove momentum in annualized revenue run-rate and gross margins in Q1 despite challenges brought by the
softening of the networking market and GPU deal timing," said Marie Myers, executive vice president and CFO of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "The fundamentals of our business are strong, we are controlling what we can control,
and we are optimistic about delivering strong shareholder returns over the remainder of the fiscal year."

         •     GAAP of 36.4%, up 240 basis points from the prior-year period and up 160 basis points sequentially

               sequentially

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 17

            •    GAAP of $0.29, down 24% from the prior-year period, and down 41% sequentially, above the midpoint
                 of our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.32
            •    Non-GAAP(1) of $0.48, down 24% from the prior-year period and down 8% sequentially, at the high
                 end of our guidance range of $0.42 to $0.50
    •       Cash flow from operations: $64 million, an increase of $893 million from the prior-year period
    •       Free cash flow ("FCF")(1)(3): $(482) million, an increase of $844 million from the prior-year period
    •       Capital returns to shareholders: $172 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases

First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Segment Results
    •       Server revenue was $3.4 billion, down 23% from the prior-year period in actual dollars and in constant
            currency(1), with 11.4% operating profit margin, compared to 15.7% from the prior-year period. The Server
            business segment combines the previously separately reported Compute and HPC & AI business
            segments, with adjustments for certain product lines that are now reported in Hybrid Cloud. The merged

    •       Financial Services revenue was $873 million, flat from the prior-year period in actual dollars and down 2%
            in constant currency(1), with 8.5% operating profit margin, compared to 7.2% from the prior-year period.
            Net portfolio assets of $13.2 billion, up 0.3% from the prior-year period in actual dollars and up 0.7% in
            constant currency(1). The business delivered return on equity of 15.4%, down 2.4 points from the prior-
            year period.

Dividend

The HPE Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.13 per share on the company's common stock,
payable on April 12, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2024.

Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Outlook

HPE estimates revenue to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $7.0 billion. HPE estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be
in the range of $0.20 to $0.25 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS(1) to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.41. Fiscal 2024
second quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude net after-tax adjustments of approximately $0.16 per
diluted share, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets.

Fiscal 2024 Outlook

HPE estimates fiscal 2024 revenue growth to be flat to 2%, in constant currency(1)(5), and fiscal 2024 GAAP
operating profit growth to be in the range of 7% to 11% and non-GAAP operating profit(1)(4) growth to be flat to 2%.
HPE estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $1.81 and $1.91 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS(1) to
be in the range of $1.82 and $1.92. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude net after-tax
adjustments of approximately $0.01 per diluted share, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense,
amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, acquisition, disposition and other related charges, structural
tax-rate adjustments, H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C. HPE estimates free cash
flow(1)(3)(5) to be at least $1.9 billion.
        1       A description of HPE's use of non-GAAP financial information is provided below under "Use of non-GAAP
                financial information and key performance metrics."

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 17

     2     Annualized Revenue Run-Rate ("ARR") is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption
           Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform
           services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and
           interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other
           as-a-Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance
           metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

     3     FCF represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant &
           equipment ("PP&E") less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate
           fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.

     4     FY24 non-GAAP operating profit excludes costs of approximately $1.0 billion primarily related to stock-based
           compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition
           and other related charges.

     5     Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis. In reliance on the exception
           provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to provide a
           reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the
           Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial
           measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Company's reported GAAP results for the
           guidance period. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise's condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on
a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial
measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP
gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-
GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP
income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow ("FCF").
Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP
diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and FCF. Reconciliations of each of these non-
GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are
included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition an
explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management uses these non-GAAP measures to
evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise's decision to use these non-GAAP
measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental useful
information to investors is included further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings
from operations), operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), net earnings,
diluted net earnings per share, and cash flow from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents
annualized revenue run-rate ("ARR") and as-a-Service ("AAS") orders as performance metrics. ARR is a financial

                                                                                                    Page 4 of 17

metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue
of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which
includes rental income for operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service
("SaaS"), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and
multiplied by four. AAS orders are an overlay across all business segments contributing to HPE's consumption-
based services (both recurring and non-recurring revenues), and includes hardware, as well as HPE GreenLake as-
a-Service, Aruba SaaS, storage SaaS, and other software assets. ARR & AAS orders should be viewed
independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.

      (3)     Other adjustments includes non-service net periodic benefit cost and tax indemnification and other
              adjustments.

      (4)     As previously disclosed, effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, in order to align
              the segment financial reporting more closely with its business structure, the Company established two
              new reportable segments, Hybrid Cloud and Server. Hybrid Cloud includes the historical Storage
              segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service IT infrastructure through
              the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and was previously reported under the Compute and the
              High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence ("HPC & AI") segments), Private Cloud, and
              Software (previously reported under the Corporate Investments and Other segment). The Server
              segment combines the previously separately reported Compute and HPC & AI segments, with
              adjustments for certain product lines that are now reported in Hybrid Cloud. Additionally, certain
              products and services previously reported in the financial results for the HPC & AI segment were moved
              to be reported in the Hybrid Cloud segment, and the Athonet business and certain components of the
              Communications and Media Solutions business, both previously reported in the financial results for
              Corporate Investments and Other, moved to be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment.

              As a result, the Company's new organizational structure consists of the following segments: (i) Server;
              (ii) Hybrid Cloud; (iii) Intelligent Edge; (iv) Financial Services; and (v) Corporate Investments and Other.
              The Company is reporting under this re-aligned segment structure beginning with the results of the first
              quarter of fiscal 2024.

              The Company has reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest
              period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for
              each of the segments as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard
              Enterprise's previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings, net earnings per share or total
              assets.



Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise's condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on
a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides non-GAAP financial measures including revenue on a constant
currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin,
non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings,
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue
growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth,
and FCF.

                                                                                                  Page 14 of 17
   Hewlett Packard Enterprise Reports Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Results Exceeds profitability expectations and
                            continues to scale recurring revenue, advancing long....

These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the
United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net
revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP
measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure
most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is earnings from
operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a
percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income
tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP
measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share.
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations. Reconciliations of each of these
non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods
are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing the non-GAAP financial measures stated above, in addition to
the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett
Packard Enterprise's management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's results "through the eyes" of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further
believes that providing this information provides Hewlett Packard Enterprise's investors with a supplemental view to
understand the Company's historical and prospective operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the
methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate and measure such
performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates the comparisons of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's operating performance with the performance of other companies in the same industry that supplement
their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

Economic substance of and material limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett
Packard Enterprise

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the
comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating the Company's past and future
performance, without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of
the U.S. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges relating to the
stock-based compensation expense, and disaster (recovery) charges. Non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP
earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a
percentage of net revenue) consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net
revenue excluding the items mentioned above and charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets,
transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-
GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding the
charges previously stated, as well as earnings from equity interests, gain or loss on equity investments, other
adjustments, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation
allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-
based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from the non-GAAP financial
measures provides a supplemental view to management and investors of its consolidated financial performance
and presents the financial results of the business without costs that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management
does not believe to be reflective of ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact
on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting their use as analytical tools. These limitations are
discussed below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. More specifically, Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:

                                                                                               Page 15 of 17

•   Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes
    these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly
    impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's acquisitions. Hewlett Packard
    Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily
    because they are non-cash expenses and the Company's internal benchmarking analyses evidence that
    many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset
    amortization. Although this does not directly affect Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cash position, the loss in
    value of intangible assets over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.
•   Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and
    Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to
    transform the Company's IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment
    charges on real estate identified as part of the initiatives. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs
    as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017
    and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure
    following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product
    portfolio in fiscal 2020. The HPE Next Plan and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan are
    substantially complete. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from the non-GAAP financial
    measures, as stated above, is to provide a supplemental measure of the Company's operating results that
    do not include material HPE Next Plan and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as the
    Company's management does not believe such costs to be reflective of its ongoing operating cost
    structure. Further, the transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have
    been materially declining since 2021 and the Company does not expect these costs to be material. Hewlett
    Packard Enterprise's management believes non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to
    management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods.
•   Disaster (recovery) charges are primarily related to the exit of the Company's businesses in Russia and
    Belarus, and include credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned
    assets. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to COVID-19 as a
    result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and subsequent
    shift to a virtual format. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes Disaster (recovery) charges from these non-
    GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the operational
    performance of the Company's business.
•   Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of
    those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees,
    Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP
    measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and the Company's internal benchmarking
    analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures
    excluding stock-based compensation expense.
•   Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges.
    The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated
    as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. For the first quarter of 2024, these charges were driven by costs
    associated with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, in addition to prior acquisitions of Axis and
    Athonet. For the first quarter of 2023, these charges were driven by acquisitions of Zerto and Determined
    AI. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration
    settlements in connection with certain dispositions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management considers
    these acquisitions and divestitures to be discrete events. The Company excludes these costs as these
    expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature
    of its acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, the Company's internal benchmarking analyses evidence
    that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.
•   For the first fiscal quarter of 2024 and prospectively, the adjustment to earnings from equity interests
    includes the equity in earnings from the H3C investment. In connection with the planned divestiture of the

                                                                                                  Page 16 of 17
   Hewlett Packard Enterprise Reports Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Results Exceeds profitability expectations and
                            continues to scale recurring revenue, advancing long....

        H3C investment, the Company stopped reporting H3C earnings in the non-GAAP results as the Company
        no longer receives dividends from this investment due to the Put Share Purchase Agreement described in
        Note 20 "Equity Method Investments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the
        Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. All periods presented
        include the amortization of the basis difference in this investment. For the first fiscal quarter of 2023, this
        adjustment also included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. The
        Company believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP financial
        measures facilitates the evaluation of the current operating performance.
    •   Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes gains and losses (including impairments) on its non-marketable
        equity investments because the Company does not believe they are reflective of normal continuing
        business operations. These adjustments are reflected in Interest and other, net in the Condensed
        Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company believes eliminating these adjustments for the
        purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of its current operating performance.
    •   Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to
        provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly
        related to the Company's operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this
        long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate
        assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors
        including Hewlett Packard Enterprise's expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and
        current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise
        operates. For fiscal 2024, the Company will use a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 15%, which
        reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income
        tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax
        environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's geographic earnings mix including due to
        acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company's strategy or business operations. The Company will
        re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2023, the Company had a non-GAAP tax rate of
        14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management believes that making these adjustments for purposes of
        calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of the Company's current operating
        performance and comparisons to past operating results.
    •   FCF is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant &
        equipment ("PP&E") less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate
        fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or
        decrease in cash for the period. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management and investors can use FCF for
        the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in the Company's businesses,
        repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating its historical and prospective liquidity.

Compensation for material limitations with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's results as reported under
GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material
impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other
companies (limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full
economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets. Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for these limitations
on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial
measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP
financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this quarter and prior periods within
this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett
Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.
