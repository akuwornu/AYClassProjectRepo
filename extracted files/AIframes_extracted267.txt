PR NewswireRamSoft's robust solutions provide Premier with unmatched speed and reliability for reading and
processing images for its fast-growing teleradiology operationsTORONTO and MIAMI, March 7, 2024
/PRNewswire/ -RamSoft, a global leader in novel cloud-based RIS/PACS radiology solutions for imaging centers
and teleradiology providers, is pleased to announce thatPremier Radiology Services("Premier"), based in Miami,
FL, has signed a 5-year agreement to use RamSoft's OmegaAI™ and cloud-based PowerServer® PACS platform
for its 1,000+ teleradiology locations. Premier is one of the largest teleradiology service providers in the US, with its
radiologists processing and reading thousands of imaging studies daily. Premier, a long-time customer of
RamSoft, committed to a 5-Year Contract because of OmegaAI and PowerServer's superior technical capabilities.
"With our 120+ radiologists reading thousands of scans daily, we require a PACS platform that is quick to
implement, reliable, fully HIPAA-compliant, and operates at the fastest speeds", saysDrew Gaudet, CEO of
Premier. "In addition, we require robust and flexible automated workflows to drive efficiencies for reviewing and
processing our cases.

RamSoft's OmegaAI and PowerServer provide best-in-class software and allow Premier to provide 24/7 radiology
services and deliver on our guarantee of average STAT-read turnaround times of under one hour".


Premier, which has multiple contracts for occupational health, primary care, urgent care, mobile and outpatient
imaging has been able to quickly deploy PowerServer in just a few hours to enable new locations to start sending
and interpreting images."We have contracts with NGOs and emergency relief organizations where we are required
to quickly establish image distribution to support disaster relief and refugee operations", saysRyan Furlough,
Premier's Chief Innovation & Technology Officer. "Recently, our team was hired to provide teleradiology reading
expertise as part of the first responder efforts for Hurricane Ian on the Gulf Coast of Florida. We were able to set up
PowerServer in under two hours, including the ability to access all of our automated workflows. This enabled our
radiologists to start reading images and reporting results right away. This flexibility, adaptability and ease of
implementation is impressive – and is another key reason that we have entered this long-term relationship with
RamSoft".
