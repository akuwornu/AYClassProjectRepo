NetApp usage of non-GAAP financial information

                                                                                                      Page 6 of 9
                           NetApp Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results

To supplement NetApp's condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-
GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margins,
non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, billings, and
historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. NetApp also presents the hardware and software
components of our GAAP product revenues. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a
configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single
performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP
measures. The hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair
value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware
and software components. This allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which NetApp has
historically billed customers for such respective components.

NetApp believes that the presentation of its non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the
corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and
business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. NetApp's management uses non-GAAP
measures in making operating decisions because it believes that the measurements provide meaningful
supplemental information regarding NetApp's ongoing operational performance.

NetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP
effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, provides investors with
supplemental metrics that assist in understanding current results and future prospects, earnings and profitability
that are complementary to GAAP metrics. Each of these Non-GAAP metrics is defined as the applicable GAAP
metric adjusted to exclude the items defined in A through I below, as applicable, while our Non-GAAP effective tax
rate and Non-GAAP net income also reflect a non-GAAP tax provision, as described in item J below, instead of our
GAAP tax provision. Non-GAAP net income per share is computed as Non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted
number of shares for the applicable period.

NetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating
activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful
information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest
in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As
free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be
considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.

NetApp believes that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is
meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the Company's software and provides
improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and R&D investment.

NetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as
reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance
measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates
the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed.

Non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2)
facilitate comparisons to our competitors' operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to
information used by management in financial and operational decision making.

NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:

Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection
with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition
activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating

                                                                                                        Page 7 of 9
                           NetApp Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results

expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes

stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate
based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based
compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an
expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.

Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp
excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing
business and operating results.

Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and
other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its
ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or
cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.

Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular
facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and
other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of
operational performance.

Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has
become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of
these events in its assessment of operational performance.

Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and
other transactions in which we transfer control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these
transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future
planning and forecasting.

Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment
in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying
businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, ongoing
business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.

Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early
extinguishment of debt. Management believes such nonrecurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying,
ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.

Income tax adjustments. NetApp's non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective
tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the
current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax
legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax
charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes,
(c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a
result of infrequent restructuring of the Company's tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a
change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges or benefits resulting from the integration of intellectual property
from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful
measure of the Company's operational performance.

Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures
are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP

                                                                                                       Page 8 of 9
                           NetApp Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results

measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of
operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the
Company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management
compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-
GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be
viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results
can be found herein.

Constant currency

In periods in which the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes are significant, NetApp presents certain
constant currency growth rates or quantifies the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on year-over-
year fluctuations, including for net revenues, billings, and earnings. This constant currency information assumes the
same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in
translation of the current period results.
