Korn Ferry (NYSE: KFY), a global organizational consulting firm, today announced third quarter fee revenue of
$668.7 million. In addition, third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.13 and adjusted diluted earnings per
share was $1.07.

"I am pleased with our third quarter results, as we generated $669 million in fee revenue, down 2% year-over-year,
with our non-search offerings providing a substantial buffer against the more cyclically sensitive recruiting offerings.
Earnings and profitability increased year-over-year and sequentially as we delivered $102 million of Adjusted
EBITDA, at a 15.2% margin," said Gary D. Burnison, CEO, Korn Ferry.

"Fee revenue from Consulting and Digital (up 3% and 6% over the prior year, respectively), when combined with
our Interim fee revenue, now generate 50% of our top line. Our Consulting bill rate increased 12% and our Digital
subscription and license fee revenue increased 11%," Burnison added. "The strategy is clearly working - I am
enormously proud of our organization and the results demonstrate the resiliency and potential for Korn Ferry."

      (        Due to actions taken in connection with the worldwide minimum tax, the Company recorded a $9.7 million
      c        non-recurring tax benefit in the quarter ended January 31, 2024 that resulted in the release of a valuation
      )        allowance, which is included in the Company's US GAAP results but excluded from the Adjusted results.

The Company reported fee revenue in Q3 FY'24 of $668.7 million, a year-over-year decrease of 2% at both actual
and constant currency. Fee revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in our permanent placement talent
acquisition offerings. This decrease was due to a decline in demand driven by uncertain and challenging global
economic environment. This was partially offset by the increases in Consulting and Digital fee revenue, as well as in
the Interim portion of Professional Search & Interim, resulting from the acquisition of Salo ('the Acquisition") which
was effective February 1, 2023.

Operating margin was 7.5% in Q3 FY'24, compared to 1.8% in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 570bps.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.2% in Q3 FY'24, compared to 14.1% in the year-ago quarter, an increase of
110bps. Net income attributable to Korn Ferry was $59.1 million in Q3 FY'24, compared to $11.2 million in Q3
FY'23 and Adjusted EBITDA was $101.7 million in Q3 FY'24 compared to $96.1 million in Q3 FY'23.

Operating income and margin increased compared to the year-ago quarter primarily due to 1) lower restructuring
charges, net recorded in Q3 FY'24 compared to the year-ago quarter, 2) a decrease in compensation and benefits
expense driven by the previous quarter's cost reduction actions, and 3) a decrease in charges for impairment of
fixed and right of use assets in the year-ago quarter. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in fee
revenue discussed above, and higher cost of services expense associated with the acquired Interim businesses.
Net income attributable to Korn Ferry increased due to the same factors discussed above.

                                                                                                                 Page 3 of 21

Fee revenue was $166.9 million in Q3 FY'24 compared to $162.2 million in Q3 FY'23, an increase of $4.7 million or

Adjusted EBITDA was $27.8 million in Q3 FY'24 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $23.3 million, in the year-ago
quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter increased year-over-year by 230bps from 14.4% last year to 16.7%
this year. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin resulted primarily from the increase in
fee revenue discussed above, combined with the previous quarter's cost reduction actions, partially offset by an
increase in cost of services expense.

Fee revenue was $199.3 million and $212.0 million in Q3 FY'24 and Q3 FY'23, respectively, a year-over-year
decrease of $12.7 million or 6% (down 7% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in fee revenue was
primarily driven by a decline in executive search activity, resulting from the uncertain and challenging global
economic environment.

Adjusted EBITDA was $43.4 million in Q3 FY'24 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $46.4 million in the year-ago
quarter. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the decrease in fee revenue discussed above,
partially offset by the previous quarter's cost reduction actions. Despite the year-over-year decrease in fee revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin remained essentially flat year-over-year due to the previous
quarter's cost reduction actions.

Fee revenue was $130.9 million in Q3 FY'24, an increase of $12.9 million or 11% at both actual and constant
currency. The increase in fee revenue was mainly driven by additional fee revenue from the Acquisition, partially
offset by a decrease in permanent placement fee revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA was $23.8 million in Q3 FY'24 compared to $22.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in
Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the increase in fee revenue discussed above and the previous quarter's cost
reduction actions, partially offset by higher cost of services expense due to the Acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA
margin declined slightly (40bps) year-over-year due to the factors noted above as well as a change in the mix of fee
revenue which included more Interim fee revenue, which has lower profitability but is less cyclical as compared to
professional search permanent placement which comprised a greater portion of fee revenue in the year-ago
quarter.

Fee revenue was $81.2 million in Q3 FY'24, a decrease of $22.3 million or 22% at both actual and constant
currency basis. RPO fee revenue decreased due to reduced demand for the number of placements being
requested by existing clients as a result of the challenging global economic environment as well as a continuation of
clients "labor hoarding".

Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million in Q3 FY'24 compared to $9.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease
resulted from the decline in fee revenue which was partially offset by cost reductions taken in the previous quarter.
Despite the year-over-year decrease in fee revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin increased
190bps year-over-year from 9.5% to 11.4% due to the previous quarter's cost reduction actions.

Outlook

Assuming worldwide geopolitical conditions, economic conditions, financial markets and foreign exchange rates
remain steady, on a consolidated basis:
    •     Q4 FY'24 fee revenue is expected to be in the range of $675 million and $695 million; and
    •     Q4 FY'24 diluted earnings per share is expected to range between $1.06 to $1.14.

On a consolidated adjusted basis:
    •     Q4 FY'24 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range from $1.09 to $1.17.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). In particular, it includes:
    •   Adjusted net income attributable to Korn Ferry, adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs,
        impairment of fixed assets, impairment of right of use assets, and restructuring charges, net of income tax
        effect and to exclude a $9.7 million non-recurring tax benefit from actions taken in connection with the
        worldwide minimum tax that resulted in the release of a valuation allowance;
    •   Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs,
        impairment of fixed assets, impairment of right of use assets, and restructuring charges, net of income tax
        effect, and to exclude a $9.7 million non-recurring tax benefit from actions taken in connection with the
        worldwide minimum tax that resulted in the release of a valuation allowance;
    •   Constant currency (calculated using a quarterly average) percentages that represent the percentage
        change that would have resulted had exchange rates in the prior period been the same as those in effect in
        the current period;
    •   Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA, which is earnings before interest, taxes,
        depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs, impairment of fixed
        assets, impairment of right of use assets and restructuring charges, net when applicable, and Consolidated
        and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA margin.

This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial
information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for

                                                                                                        Page 10 of 21

analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP
performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release provides meaningful
supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance by excluding certain charges that may not be
indicative of Korn Ferry's ongoing operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are performance
measures and are not indicative of the liquidity of Korn Ferry. These charges, which are described in the footnotes
in the attached reconciliations, represent 1) costs we incurred to acquire and integrate a portion of our Professional
Search & Interim business, 2) impairment of fixed assets primarily due to software impairment charge in our Digital
segment in FY'24 and impairment on leasehold improvements due to terminating and deciding to sublease some of
our office leases in FY'23, 3) impairment of right of use assets due to the decision to terminate and sublease some
of our offices, 4) Restructuring charges, net to align workforce to the challenging macroeconomic business
environment arising from persistent inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and global economic and geopolitical
uncertainty and 5) to exclude a $9.7 million non-recurring tax benefit from actions taken in connection with the
worldwide minimum tax that resulted in the release of a valuation allowance. The use of non-GAAP financial
measures facilitates comparisons to Korn Ferry's historical performance. Korn Ferry includes non-GAAP financial
measures because management believes they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with
respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing operations and
financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted net income attributable to Korn Ferry, adjusted basic and
diluted earnings per share and Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA, exclude certain charges that
management does not consider on-going in nature and allows management and investors to make more
meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results. Management further believes that
Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by
investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital
structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes and capitalized asset values, all of which can vary substantially from
company to company. In the case of constant currency percentages, management believes the presentation of
such information provides useful supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance as excluding the
impact of exchange rate changes on Korn Ferry's financial performance allows investors to make more meaningful
period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results, to better identify operating trends that may
otherwise be masked or distorted by exchange rate changes and to perform related trend analysis, and provides a
higher degree of transparency of information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing
operations and financial and operational decision-making.
