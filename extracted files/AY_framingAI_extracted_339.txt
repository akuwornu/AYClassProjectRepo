HAProxy Technologies’ leadership of the API Management, DDoS Protection, DevOps, Web Application Firewall
(WAF), and Web Security categories confirms the company’s position as a leading security and automation
solutions provider for applications and APIs. Recent milestones have supported HAProxy Technologies’ successful
expansion into these critical markets.

Security

HAProxy’s resilient, high-performance architecture and robust, peer-reviewed open source codebase make it one of
the most trustable layers in an application delivery stack. In October 2023, we announced that HAProxy is Not
Affected by the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack (CVE-2023-44487). In April 2024, we also announced that HAProxy is
Resilient to the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood.

In May 2024, we announced the release of HAProxy Enterprise 2.9 – a milestone release that defined a new
security standard for application delivery with next-generation WAF and bot management capabilities that provide
advanced security, high performance, and simple management.

HAProxy Technologies presented the security features of HAProxy Enterprise 2.9 at RSA Conference 2024 with the
live session "Don’t let bots get you down: better bot management for stronger enterprise security" presented by
Nenad Merdanovic, Principal Solutions Architect and the on-demand session "Beating the Top 3 Challenges Facing
the Critical WAF Security Layer" presented by Jakub Suchy, Director, Solutions Engineering.

Automation

In November 2023, we announced the release of HAProxy Fusion 1.2 with Service Discovery for Kubernetes and
Consul. HAProxy Fusion links to the Kubernetes API, which lets HAProxy Enterprise dynamically update service
configurations. This combination enables automated external load balancing for on-premises Kubernetes and multi-
cluster routing for Kubernetes in public clouds.

HAProxy Technologies presented the infrastructure automation capabilities of HAProxy Fusion at AWS re:Invent
2023. In the live session “Scalable load balancing and security made simple on AWS”, Jakub Suchy highlighted the
challenges that arise with high-scale load balancing on AWS, including increasing costs, latency issues, and the
complexity of managing sprawl. Our solution: consolidating multiple layers into a single high-performance load
balancing layer, enhanced by centralized management, monitoring, and automation with HAProxy Fusion.

Earlier this month, HAProxy Technologies sponsored the France API 2024 event and demonstrated our API
gateway and AI/ML gateway solutions and how to automate HAProxy infrastructure using HAProxy Fusion’s
centralized API.
