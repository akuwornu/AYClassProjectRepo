Body

The Hartford (NYSE: HIG) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2023.

"Fourth quarter and full year 2023 results were simply outstanding, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy,
and our ability to consistently execute," said The Hartford's Chairman and CEO Christopher Swift. "Our 2023 core
earnings ROE of 15.8 percent reflects exceptional underwriting in Commercial Lines, record core earnings from
Group Benefits, and continued solid performance from our investment portfolio."

The Hartford's Chief Financial Officer Beth Costello said, "Commercial Lines had a superb quarter with an
underlying combined ratio of 86.6. Personal Lines achieved sustained double-digit written pricing increases with
acceleration in auto to 21.9 percent in the quarter, responding to the dynamic loss cost environment. Group
Benefits continues to deliver excellent results driven by 6 percent growth in fully insured ongoing premiums and a
core earnings margin of 9.8 percent. Our investment performance remains strong benefiting from attractive new
money yields and a diversified portfolio of assets. We are actively managing our capital and returned $479 million
through repurchases and dividends in the quarter contributing to total capital return of $6.2 billion to shareholders
over the last three years."

Swift continued, "Building on another quarter and full year of exceptional performance, we are well positioned to
sustain these results in 2024. Our diverse yet complementary portfolio of businesses, coupled with our ongoing
investments in growth and innovation, give me great confidence in our ability to deliver for customers and sustain
industry leading core earnings ROEs anchored at 15 percent."

Fourth quarter 2023 net income available to common stockholders of $766 million, or $2.51 per diluted share,
improved compared with $587 million in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to a higher P&C underwriting gain,
including strong premium growth in Commercial Lines, and improvement in the Group Benefits loss ratio, with
premium growth in both group life and disability, partially offset by a change to net realized losses in the 2023
period compared to net realized gains in the 2022 period. Included in the fourth quarter 2023 net income was a
charge for a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance of $194 million, before tax, related to asbestos and
environmental reserves compared to a charge of $229 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2022.

Fourth quarter 2023 core earnings of $935 million, or $3.06 per diluted share, compared with $749 million of core
earnings in fourth quarter 2022. Contributing to the results were:
   •    An increase in earnings generated by 9% growth in P&C earned premium and 6% growth in Group
        Benefits fully insured ongoing premium.
   •    Net favorable prior accident year development (PYD) in core earnings of $102 million, before tax, in 2023,
        compared with net favorable PYD of $46 million in core earnings in 2022. Among other changes, net
        favorable PYD in 2023 primarily included reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, and
        bond, partially offset by reserve increases in assumed reinsurance and commercial auto liability.
   •    Group Benefits loss ratio of 69.9% improved 3.5 points compared with 73.4% primarily due to improved
        mortality and favorable long-term disability recoveries.
   •    P&C current accident year (CAY) catastrophe (CAT) losses of $81 million, before tax, in fourth quarter
        2023, compared with CAY CAT losses of $135 million in fourth quarter 2022.

                                                                                               Page 3 of 27

    •   Commercial Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 54.2 improved 3.2 points compared with 57.4
        in fourth quarter 2022, including 2.1 points of lower CATs, and 1.4 points of more favorable PYD.
        Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio* increased 0.4 points, to 56.1 in fourth quarter 2023
        from 55.7 in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to a slightly higher loss ratio in workers' compensation, auto,
        and environmental, partially offset by lower net non-CAT property losses driven by Small Commercial.
    •   Personal Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 76.6 compared with 74.4 in fourth quarter 2022,
        including a change from unfavorable PYD of 0.1 points in fourth quarter 2022 to favorable PYD of 0.9
        points in fourth quarter 2023, and 0.2 points of lower CATs. Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense
        ratio of 74.9 in fourth quarter 2023 compared with 71.5 in fourth quarter 2022, with the increase largely due
        to higher severity in auto liability and physical damage, partially offset by double-digit earned pricing
        increases benefiting both auto and homeowners.
    •   The expense ratios improved across P&C and Group Benefits from fourth quarter 2022, driven by the
        impact of higher earned premium, lower incentive compensation, and incremental savings from Hartford
        Next initiatives, partially offset by investments in technology and higher staffing costs.
    •   Net investment income of $653 million, before tax, compared with $640 million in fourth quarter 2022,
        driven by higher yields on the fixed income portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $87 million in income
        from limited partnerships and other alternative investments (LPs).

Full year 2023 net income available to common stockholders of $2.5 billion, or $7.97 per diluted share, compared
with $1.8 billion in the 2022 period, primarily due to lower net realized losses, improvements in both the group life
and disability loss ratios, as well as an increase in earned premiums, higher net investment income, and a higher
P&C underwriting gain. Included in 2023 net income was a charge for a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance of
$194 million, before tax, related to asbestos and environmental reserves compared to a charge of $229 million,
before tax, in 2022.

Full year 2023 core earnings of $2.8 billion, or $8.88 per diluted share, compared with $2.5 billion of core earnings
in the 2022 period. Contributing to the results were:
    •   An increase in earnings generated by 9% growth in P&C earned premium and a 7% increase in Group
        Benefits fully insured ongoing premium.
    •   Net investment income of $2.3 billion, before tax, compared with $2.2 billion in 2022, driven by higher
        yields on the fixed income portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $303 million in income from LPs.
    •   Group Benefits loss ratio of 71.8% improved 2.7 points compared with 74.5% primarily due to improved
        mortality and favorable long-term disability claim incidence and recoveries.
    •   Net favorable PYD in core earnings of $184 million, before tax, in 2023, compared with net favorable PYD
        of $193 million in core earnings in 2022. Among other changes, net favorable PYD in 2023 primarily
        included reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond, and package business, partially
        offset by reserve increases in general liability and assumed reinsurance.
    •   Commercial Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 58.3 compared with 58.4 in 2022, including
        lower CATs of 0.5 points and less favorable PYD of 0.3 points. Underlying loss and loss adjustment
        expense ratio of 56.5 in 2023 compared with 56.4 in 2022, driven by a slightly higher loss ratio in workers'
        compensation, as expected, offset by lower non-CAT property losses in Middle & Large Commercial.
    •   Personal Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 82.2 compared with 73.4 in 2022, including a 0.8
        point change from favorable PYD in 2022 to unfavorable PYD in 2023 and 0.7 points of higher CATs.
        Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 74.1 in 2023 compared with 66.8 in 2022, with the
        increase largely due to higher severity in auto liability and physical damage, and higher non-CAT
        homeowners losses, partially offset by double-digit earned pricing increases benefiting both auto and
        homeowners.

                                                                                               Page 4 of 27

   •    The expense ratios improved across P&C and Group Benefits, driven by the impact of higher earned
        premium, lower incentive compensation, incremental savings from Hartford Next initiatives and lower
        marketing expense in Personal Lines, partially offset by investments in technology and higher staffing
        costs.
   •    P&C CAY CAT losses of $676 million, before tax, in 2023, compared with $649 million in 2022.

Dec. 31, 2023, book value per diluted share of $49.43 increased 18.6%, from $41.67 at Dec. 31, 2022, principally
due to net income in excess of stockholder dividends through Dec. 31, 2023, and improved net unrealized losses
on investments within AOCI driven by tighter credit spreads, partially offset by the dilutive effect of share
repurchases.

Book value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) of $58.83 as of Dec. 31, 2023, increased 9.6%, from $53.66 at Dec.
31, 2022, as the impact from net income in excess of stockholder dividends through Dec. 31, 2023 was partially
offset by the dilutive effect of share repurchases.

Net income available to common stockholders' ROE (net income ROE) for the 12-month period ending Dec. 31,
2023, was 17.5%, an increase of 5.8 points from fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to an increase in 12-month
trailing net income available to common stockholders, and an increase in average net unrealized losses on
investments in AOCI.

Core earnings ROE for the 12-month period ending Dec. 31, 2023, was 15.8%, an increase of 1.3 points from fourth
quarter 2022 due to higher trailing 12-month core earnings.

losses, and more favorable PYD, as well as higher net investment income, partially offset by greater net realized
losses.

Commercial Lines core earnings of $723 million in fourth quarter 2023 compared with $562 million in fourth quarter
2022. Contributing to the results were:
    •   10% growth in earned premium.
    •   CAY CAT losses of $60 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2023, primarily from tornado, wind and hail
        events across several regions of the United States, down from CAY CAT losses of $114 million in fourth
        quarter 2022, which included $151 million from Winter Storm Elliott and $56 million of favorable
        development on prior quarter catastrophes.
    •   Net favorable PYD within core earnings of $118 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2023, compared with
        $68 million of net favorable PYD within core earnings in fourth quarter 2022. The net favorable PYD in
        fourth quarter 2023 primarily includes reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes and
        bond, partially offset by reserve increases in assumed reinsurance and auto liability.
    •   An underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 56.1, in fourth quarter 2023 compared with 55.7 in
        fourth quarter 2022, principally due to a slightly higher loss ratio in workers' compensation, auto, and
        environmental, partially offset by lower net non-CAT property losses driven by Small Commercial.
    •   Net investment income of $435 million, before tax, compared with $411 million in fourth quarter 2022.

Combined ratio of 84.7 in fourth quarter 2023, improved 4.3 points compared with 89.0 in fourth quarter 2022,
primarily due to 2.1 points of lower CAY CAT losses, 1.4 points of more favorable PYD, and a 0.8 point decrease in
the underlying combined ratio. Underlying combined ratio of 86.6 improved from 87.4 in fourth quarter 2022
primarily due to a 1.1 point decrease in the expense ratio, partially offset by a 0.4 point increase in the underlying
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio.
    •   Small Commercial combined ratio of 84.0 compared with 89.4 in fourth quarter 2022, including 2.9 points of
        lower CAY CATs and 0.7 points of more favorable PYD. Underlying combined ratio of 85.8 compared with
        87.5 in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to lower non-CAT property losses and a lower expense ratio,
        partially offset by higher loss ratios in workers' compensation.
    •   Middle & Large Commercial combined ratio of 89.3 compared with 91.8 in fourth quarter 2022, including
        3.0 points of lower CAY CATs, partially offset by 0.3 points of less favorable PYD. Underlying combined
        ratio of 90.3, a slight increase of 0.1 points from 90.2 in fourth quarter 2022, due to an increase in the loss
        ratio for commercial auto and higher non-CAT property losses, largely offset by a lower expense ratio.
    •   Global Specialty combined ratio of 79.6 improved from 84.1 in fourth quarter 2022, benefiting from a 4.6
        point increase in favorable PYD. The underlying combined ratio of 82.9 improved 0.1 points from fourth
        quarter 2022, primarily due to a lower loss ratio in U.S. wholesale and a lower expense ratio, partially offset
        by a higher loss ratio in environmental.
    •   The Commercial Lines expense ratio of 30.2 improved 1.1 points from fourth quarter 2022, driven by the
        impact of higher earned premium, lower incentive compensation and incremental savings from Hartford
        Next initiatives, partially offset by investments in technology.

Fourth quarter 2023 written premiums of $3.0 billion were up 9% from fourth quarter 2022, with increases across
the segment, including continued expansion in property lines, strong growth in new business, including a 28%
increase in Middle & Large Commercial, and the effect of renewal written price increases, as well as growth in

Net income of $34 million in fourth quarter 2023 compared with net income of $44 million in fourth quarter 2022,
driven by lower underwriting results, and a change from net realized gains to net realized losses, partially offset by
an increase in net investment income.

Personal Lines core earnings of $36 million compared with $42 million of core earnings in fourth quarter 2022.
Contributing to the results were:
    •   An underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 74.9 in fourth quarter 2023 compared with 71.5 in
        fourth quarter 2022, with the increase primarily driven by higher severity in auto liability and physical
        damage, partially offset by double-digit earned pricing increases in auto and homeowners.
    •   Net investment income of $52 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2023 compared with $41 million in fourth
        quarter 2022.
    •   $7 million, before tax, of favorable PYD in fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $1 million unfavorable
        PYD in fourth quarter 2022. The net favorable PYD in fourth quarter 2023 is driven by a reserve reduction
        in homeowners.

Combined ratio of 101.2 in fourth quarter 2023, compared with 99.1 in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to a 3.4
point increase in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, partially offset by a 1.0 point change from
unfavorable PYD in fourth quarter 2022 to favorable in fourth quarter 2023, and a 0.2 point decrease in the CAY
CAT ratio. Underlying combined ratio of 99.5 compared with 96.2 in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to an
increase in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in auto, partially offset by a lower non-CAT CAY
homeowners loss ratio, and a slight improvement in the expense ratio.
    •   Auto combined ratio of 113.7 compared with 108.6 in fourth quarter 2022. The underlying combined ratio of
        113.5 increased from 108.9 in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to an increase in auto liability and physical
        damage severity, partially offset by an increase in earned pricing.
    •   Homeowners combined ratio of 72.7 compared with 78.1 in fourth quarter 2022. The underlying combined
        ratio of 67.3 improved from 68.3 in fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to a lower expense ratio, and the
        effect of double-digit earned pricing increases which more than offset the change in weather and non-
        weather loss costs.

The expense ratio of 24.6 improved 0.1 points from fourth quarter 2022, primarily driven by the impact of higher
earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing costs.

Written premiums in fourth quarter 2023 were $780 million compared with $695 million in fourth quarter 2022 with:

                                                                                               Page 7 of 27

    •   Renewal written price increases in auto and homeowners of 21.9% and 14.7%, respectively, in response to
        increased loss cost trends.
    •   An increase in new business in both auto and homeowners. Auto new business premium increased $24
        million, or 59%, over fourth quarter 2022.
    •   Modestly lower effective policy count retention, driven by renewal written price increases.

Net income of $176 million in fourth quarter 2023 increased from $143 million in fourth quarter 2022, largely driven
by improved group life and disability loss ratios, a lower expense ratio, and earnings generated from growth in fully
insured ongoing premium, partially offset by lower net investment income. Core earnings were $174 million, up from
$144 million in fourth quarter 2022, consistent with the growth in net income.

Fully insured ongoing premiums were up 6% compared with fourth quarter 2022, driven by strong persistency and
new business sales as well as an increase in exposure on existing accounts. Fully insured ongoing sales were $71
million in fourth quarter 2023, compared to $102 million in fourth quarter 2022, due to a decrease in large account
sales.

Loss ratio of 69.9% decreased 3.5 points from fourth quarter 2022.
    •   Group life loss ratio of 83.0% improved 6.1 points largely driven by a lower level of mortality.
    •   Group disability loss ratio was 63.6% compared with 65.5% in fourth quarter 2022 primarily due to
        continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries, partially offset by higher short-term disability and
        Paid Family Leave loss incidence.

Expense ratio of 24.2 improved 0.8 points from fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to the effect of higher earned
premiums, incremental expense savings from Hartford Next, and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by
higher staffing costs.

Net investment income of $125 million, before tax, compared with $154 million in fourth quarter 2022, primarily
driven by lower income from LPs, partially offset by higher yields on the fixed income portfolio.

Fourth quarter 2023 included $82 million, before tax, of LP income as compared with $169 million in fourth quarter
2022. Annualized LP yield, before tax, of 7.0% compared to 16.8% in fourth quarter 2022. The change is due to
lower income from sales of underlying real estate properties in fourth quarter 2023 compared with the 2022 period.

Net realized losses of $27 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2023 compared to net realized gains of $22 million,
before tax, in fourth quarter 2022 primarily due to lower net gains on equity securities.

Total invested assets of $55.9 billion increased $3.4 billion from Dec. 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in fixed
maturities, available-for-sale, at fair value and LPs, partially offset by a decrease in equity securities, at fair value.

The Hartford defines increases or decreases greater than or equal to 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net
loss position, or vice versa, as "NM" or not meaningful.

DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Hartford uses non-GAAP financial measures in this news release to assist investors in analyzing the
company's operating performance for the periods presented herein. Because The Hartford's calculation of these
measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing
The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. Definitions and calculations of other
financial measures used in this news release can be found below and in The Hartford's Investor Financial
Supplement for fourth quarter 2023, which is available on The Hartford's website, https://ir.thehartford.com .

Annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments - This non-GAAP
measure is calculated as (a) the annualized net investment income, on a Consolidated, P&C or Group Benefits
level, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, divided by (b) the monthly average invested
assets at amortized cost, as applicable, excluding derivatives book value and limited partnerships and other
alternative investments. The Company believes that annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and
other alternative investments, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings
because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative
investments. Annualized investment yield is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the
annualized investment yield to annualized investment yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternatives
investments for the quarterly periods and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022 is provided in the table
below.

Book value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) - This is a non-GAAP per share measure that is calculated by
dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive
potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the
Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes
that excluding AOCI from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can
fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted
share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. A reconciliation of book value per diluted share to book
value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) is provided in the table below.

Core earnings - The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the
Company's operating performance. The Hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable
measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and
financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items. Therefore, the
following items are excluded from core earnings:
    •    Certain realized gains and losses - Generally realized gains and losses are primarily driven by investment
         decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the
         insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all
         realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market
         conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized gains and losses are integrally related to
         our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic
         settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting
         item included in the income statement such as net investment income.
    •    Restructuring and other costs - Costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating
         expense of the business.

                                                                                              Page 18 of 27

                          measure not calculated in accordance with generally a....

    •   Loss on extinguishment of debt - Largely consisting of make-whole payments or tender premiums upon
        paying debt off before maturity, these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business.
    •   Gains and losses on reinsurance transactions - Gains or losses on reinsurance, such as those entered into
        upon sale of a business or to reinsure loss reserves, are not a recurring operating expense of the business.
    •   Integration and other non-recurring M&A costs - These costs, including transaction costs incurred in
        connection with an acquired business, are incurred over a short period of time and do not represent an
        ongoing operating expense of the business.
    •   Change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business - These changes in loss reserves are excluded
        from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the
        acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition.
    •   Deferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain -
        Retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and excluding the deferred
        gain on retroactive reinsurance and related amortization of the deferred gain from core earnings provides
        greater insight into the economics of the business.
    •   Change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non-core components of before tax income -
        These changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non-core
        components of before tax income, such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards.
    •   Results of discontinued operations - These results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or
        held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our
        ongoing businesses.

In addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core
earnings, preferred stock dividends declared, which are excluded from net income, are included in the
determination of core earnings. Preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on
debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding.

Net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or
net income (loss) available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's
business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income
(loss) available to common stockholders, and core earnings when reviewing the Company's performance.

A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for the quarterly periods and twelve months ended Dec. 31,
2023 and 2022, is included in this news release. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for individual
reporting segments can be found in this news release under the heading "The Hartford Financial Services Group,
Inc. Consolidating Income Statements" and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the quarter ended
Dec. 31, 2023.

Core earnings margin - The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it
is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is
calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income
margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The
Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of
Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and
realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin
should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Group
Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and
net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin for
the quarterly periods and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, is set forth below.

Core earnings per diluted share - This non-GAAP per share measure is calculated using the non-GAAP financial
measure core earnings rather than the GAAP measure net income. The Company believes that core earnings per
diluted share provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's operating performance for the same
reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core earnings. Net income (loss) available to common stockholders
per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings per diluted share should
not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share
and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company believes that it is
useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share and
core earnings per diluted share when reviewing the Company's performance. A reconciliation of net income
available to common stockholders per diluted common share to core earnings per diluted share for the quarterly

Core Earnings Return on Equity - The Company provides different measures of the return on stockholders' equity
(ROE). Core earnings ROE is calculated based on non-GAAP financial measures. Core earnings ROE is calculated
by dividing (a) the non-GAAP measure core earnings for the prior four fiscal quarters by (b) the non-GAAP measure
average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI. Net income ROE is the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measure. The Company excludes AOCI in the calculation of core earnings ROE to provide investors with a
measure of how effectively the Company is investing the portion of the Company's net worth that is primarily
attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company provides to investors return on equity measures
based on its non-GAAP core earnings financial measure for the reasons set forth in the core earnings definition. A
quantitative reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders ROE to core earnings ROE is not
calculable on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of realized gains and
losses, which typically vary substantially from period to period.

A reconciliation of consolidated net income available to common stockholders ROE to consolidated core earnings
ROE is set forth below.

Underlying combined ratio- This non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio
before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon
acquisition of a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes
this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and
unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development.
The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because
such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior
to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors' ability to assess the Company's financial
performance. A reconciliation of the combined ratio to the underlying combined ratio for individual reporting
segments can be found in this news release under the heading "Business Results" for Commercial Lines" and
"Personal Lines". A reconciliation of the combined ratio to underlying combined ratio for lines of business within the
Company's P&C reporting segments is set forth below.

Underwriting gain (loss) - The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines
segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax non-GAAP
measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting
expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced
significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over
time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage
exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of
reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides
investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are
managed separately from the Company's investing activities. A reconciliation of net income to underwriting gain
(loss) for the quarterly periods and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, is set forth below.

Underlying underwriting gain (loss) - This non-GAAP measure of underwriting profitability represents underwriting
gain (loss) before current accident year catastrophes, PYD and current accident year change in loss reserves upon
acquisition of a business. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The Company
believes underlying underwriting gain (loss) is important to understand the Company's periodic earnings because
the volatile and unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and prior accident year reserve
development could obscure underwriting trends. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are
also excluded from underlying underwriting gain (loss) because such changes could obscure the ability to compare
results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our

Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio - This non-GAAP financial measure of the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio for Commercial Lines and Personal Lines represents the loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. The loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is an
important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe
losses and prior accident year reserve development. A reconciliation of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
to the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the quarterly periods and twelve months ended Dec.
31, 2023 and 2022, is set forth below.

words such as "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "projects," and similar
references to future periods.

Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding future
economic, competitive, legislative and other developments and their potential effect upon The Hartford Financial

                                                                                              Page 25 of 27

Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "The Hartford"). Because forward-looking
statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that
are difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from expectations depending on the evolution of various
factors, including the risks and uncertainties identified below, as well as factors described in such forward-looking
statements; or in The Hartford's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    •   Risks Relating to Economic, Political and Global Market Conditions: challenges related to the Company's
        current operating environment, including global political, economic and market conditions, and the effect of
        financial market disruptions, economic downturns, changes in trade regulation including tariffs and other
        barriers or other potentially adverse macroeconomic developments on the demand for our products and
        returns in our investment portfolios; market risks associated with our business, including changes in credit
        spreads, equity prices, interest rates, inflation rate, foreign currency exchange rates and market volatility;
        the impact on our investment portfolio if our investment portfolio is concentrated in any particular segment
        of the economy; the impacts of changing climate and weather patterns on our businesses, operations and
        investment portfolio including on claims, demand and pricing of our products, the availability and cost of
        reinsurance, our modeling data used to evaluate and manage risks of catastrophes and severe weather
        events, the value of our investment portfolios and credit risk with reinsurers and other counterparties;
    •   Insurance Industry and Product-Related Risks: the possibility of unfavorable loss development, including
        with respect to long-tailed exposures; the significant uncertainties that limit our ability to estimate the
        ultimate reserves necessary for asbestos and environmental claims; the possibility of another pandemic,
        civil unrest, earthquake, or other natural or man-made disaster that may adversely affect our businesses;
        weather and other natural physical events, including the intensity and frequency of thunderstorms,
        tornadoes, hail, wildfires, flooding, winter storms, hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as climate change
        and its potential impact on weather patterns; the possible occurrence of terrorist attacks and the
        Company's inability to contain its exposure as a result of, among other factors, the inability to exclude
        coverage for terrorist attacks from workers' compensation policies and limitations on reinsurance coverage
        from the federal government under applicable laws; the Company's ability to effectively price its products
        and policies, including its ability to obtain regulatory consents to pricing actions or to non-renewal or
        withdrawal of certain product lines; actions by competitors that may be larger or have greater financial
        resources than we do; technological changes, including usage-based methods of determining premiums,
        advancements in certain emerging technologies, including machine learning, predictive analytics, "big
        data" analysis or other artificial intelligence functions, advancements in automotive safety features, the
        development of autonomous vehicles, and platforms that facilitate ride sharing; the Company's ability to
        market, distribute and provide insurance products and investment advisory services through current and
        future distribution channels and advisory firms; the uncertain effects of emerging claim and coverage
        issues; political instability, politically motivated violence or civil unrest, which may increase the frequency
        and severity of insured losses; the ongoing effects of COVID-19, including exposure to COVID-19 business
        interruption property claims and the possibility of a resurgence of COVID-19 related losses in Group
        Benefits;

Financial Strength, Credit and Counterparty Risks: risks to our business, financial position, prospects and results
associated with negative rating actions or downgrades in the Company's financial strength and credit ratings or
negative rating actions or downgrades relating to our investments; capital requirements which are subject to many
factors, including many that are outside the Company's control, such as National Association of Insurance
Commissioners ("NAIC") risk based capital formulas, rating agency capital models, Funds at Lloyd's and Solvency
Capital Requirement, which can in turn affect our credit and financial strength ratings, cost of capital, regulatory
compliance and other aspects of our business and results; losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others,
including credit risk with counterparties associated with investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, reinsurance
recoverables and indemnifications provided by third parties in connection with previous dispositions; the potential
for losses due to our reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts and

                                                                                              Page 26 of 27

the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance to protect the Company against losses; state and international
regulatory limitations on the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends;

Risks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations: risks associated with the use of analytical models in
making decisions in key areas such as underwriting, pricing, capital management, reserving, investments,
reinsurance and catastrophe risk management; the potential for differing interpretations of the methodologies,
estimations and assumptions that underlie the Company's fair value estimates for its investments and the
evaluation of intent-to-sell impairments and allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities and
mortgage loans; the potential for impairments of our goodwill;

Strategic and Operational Risks: the Company's ability to maintain the availability of its systems and safeguard the
security of its data in the event of a disaster, cyber or other information security incident or other unanticipated
event; the potential for difficulties arising from outsourcing and similar third-party relationships; the risks, challenges
and uncertainties associated with capital management plans, expense reduction initiatives and other actions; risks
associated with acquisitions and divestitures, including the challenges of integrating acquired companies or
businesses, which may result in our inability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies and may result in
unintended consequences; difficulty in attracting and retaining talented and qualified personnel, including key
employees, such as executives, managers and employees with strong technological, analytical and other
specialized skills; the Company's ability to protect its intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement;

Regulatory and Legal Risks: the cost and other potential effects of increased federal, state and international
regulatory and legislative developments, including those that could adversely impact the demand for the Company's
products, operating costs and required capital levels; unfavorable judicial or legislative developments; the impact of
changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws; regulatory requirements that could delay, deter or prevent a takeover
attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests; and the impact of potential changes in accounting
principles and related financial reporting requirements.

Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this document speaks only as of the date of this release.
Factors or events that could cause the Company's actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is
not possible for the Company to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
