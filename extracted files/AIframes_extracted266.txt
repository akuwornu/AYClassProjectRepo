Body


NICE (Nasdaq: NICE) today announced that it has launched a second CXone Cloud Region in Japan. This
presents a unique and critical functionality tailored specifically for the Japanese market. NICE will provide a
business continuity (BCP) service for CXone in Osaka, enhancing the overall resilience of CXone cloud
infrastructure for Japanese customers. Osaka's robust infrastructure and connectivity made it a strategic choice for
hosting BCP cloud services, providing reliable and high-performance solutions for NICE customer business needs.

There is increased demand in Japan for reliable and secure cloud services. Many organizations in Japan have strict
requirements to ensure business stability during unexpected outages. The new Osaka business continuity offering
is designed to enable CXone customers in Japan to be able to operate contact center services within Japan
observing regulatory requirements, in the event of a natural disaster. With this new BCP service, NICE customers
in the region can deliver exceptional Enlighten-powered CX without interruption and while keeping their data
protected.

Darren Rushworth, President, NICE International, said, "This investment demonstrates NICE's commitment to
better serve its Japanese customers. NICE understands the unique challenges in the region when it comes to
natural disasters. This enhances the overall resilience of the CXone cloud infrastructure, ensuring business
continuity for customers in the face of unforeseen events like earthquakes and typhoons. NICE intends to continue
to invest in Japan to optimize service in the market."

Mary Wardley, VP Customer Service and Contact Center Applications, IDC, said, "The challenge of delivering
global solutions is providing for the requirements of each geography. NICE's continued investment in Japan
represents the company's focus on delivering consistent and secure CX AI technology to its customers in the
region."
