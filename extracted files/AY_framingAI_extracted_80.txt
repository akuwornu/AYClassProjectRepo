2. A rapidly evolving sector

The United States is now in the early stages of a momentous transition in the automotive sector. Over the last
decade, improvements in lithium-ion battery technology and electric motors have made long-range, highly-capable
and increasingly-affordable electric vehicles a reality (Figures 1 and 2).

It is important to recall how rapidly the electric vehicle sector is evolving. The first true massmarket electric vehicle,
the Tesla Model 3 sedan, was launched just seven years ago. Over that time, the cost of lithium-ion battery packs
has been cut in half, while the energy stored per kilogram has nearly doubled.1 Tesla's Model Y crossover was only
released in 2020. Just four years later, Tesla delivered 1.2 million Model Ys, making it the world's best-selling
vehicle last year.2 Not the world's best-selling electric vehicle (though it also held that title), but the best-selling
vehicle in the world, period.

Today, Tesla is no longer (virtually) alone in the market. There are now more than 40 fully electric car or truck
models to choose from in the U.S. (and many more plug-in hybrid electric models) produced by virtually every major
automaker.3 Over 1.1 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were delivered to U.S. consumers in 2023, alongside
over 183,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).4 By the end of 2023, almost one in ten light duty vehicles
sold in the U.S. had a plug (including both BEVs and PHEVs; Figure3).5

Worldwide, nearly one in five new cars and trucks were electric in 2023, with almost 14 million EVs sold, while in
China, the world's largest automotive market, plug-in vehicles took 38% of the market last year.6

3. Why electrification is important

The transition to electric vehicles is a central pillar in the United States' efforts to both cut greenhouse gas
emissions and reduce our vulnerability to shocks in global oil markets.

Today, the United States is producing more oil than any country in the history of the world (including at any point
during the previous administration).7 And yet, the U.S. economy remains dangerously exposed to the volatility of
global oil prices. The decisions of a dictator to invade a neighbor or a disaster on the other side of the world can
send the cost of filling the tank in Denver or Des Moines soaring almost overnight and tip the whole U.S. economy
towards recession. Every $10 per barrel increase in the price of oil is a $210 million per day tax on American
households and businesses,8 and soaring energy costs are a primary driver of inflation. We simply cannot drill our
way to energy security. But we can electrify. By severing our reliance on gasoline and diesel to fuel our cars and
trucks, we can finally secure America's independence from global oil shocks.

Electrifying transportation is also critical to meeting national climate objectives. Switching to electric vehicles and
cleaning up our grid is the critical 'one-two punch' that will decarbonize transportation. President Biden established
a target to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to half of peak levels by 2030. To reach this goal, electric vehicle
sales should make up about 50% of the light duty vehicle market by that date, up about five-fold from today.9 Yet
over the past nine months, sales of plug-in vehicles in the United States have plateaued, driving a growing gap
between current trends and U.S. climate targets. Let's dive into the numbers...

4. Recent trends in the U.S. EV market

Electric vehicle sales growth accelerated through the 3rd quarter of 2023, regularly exhibiting year-on-year growth
rates of roughly 40-60%. Beginning in the 4th quarter of 2023, however, growth in EV sales stalled, a trend that has
continued through the first half of this year (see Figure 3).

At the current pace, sales of fully electric vehicles are basically flat in 2024 (up only 2% year to date) while sales of
plug-in vehicles (including PHEVs) are up 9% year-on-year (see Figure 4). That is a remarkable collapse from
2023, which saw EV sales grow by more than 50% for the year (notwithstanding the slowdown in the fourth
quarter).10

New technologies typically follow an S-shaped adoption curve, with an early phase of exponential growth that
eventually gives way to a linear phase after early adopters are exhausted (see Figure 6). Experts thus expected a
slow-down in 2024 sales growth. But this collapse is atypically fast: Bloomberg NEF projected 20% annual growth
in EV sales in 2024 while our most recent REPEAT Project scenarios expected 30-40% growth, rates that are now
nearly impossible to reach this year (Figure 4).

Looking behind the headlines, it is clear that the story is mostly about Tesla. The EV market leader has stumbled:
over the first half of 2024, Tesla sales contracted by 13% year-on-year, while sales of all other plug-in vehicles are -
actually up a healthy 31% (see Figure 4).

***

Hybrid Electric Vehicle Sales

Tesla currently has an aging and comparatively limited product line-up. The company depends on the Model 3 and
Y to drive volume sales, with these two models historically accounting for about 95% of Tesla's deliveries in recent
quarters.11 While the Model 3 went through a modest update earlier this year, the Model Y has not been
substantially redesigned since its release in 2020. Instead of refreshing their top-selling models or producing a
cheaper compact EV, Tesla devoted most of its product development efforts over the past several years to the
Cybertruck, which launched at the end of 2023. While the distinctive vehicle has quickly become the top-selling
electric truck in the market, 12 the Cybertruck currently retails for over $100,000 and is selling at an annualized
pace of less than 50,000 units (as of May 2024). Meanwhile, Tesla has used substantial price reductions (beginning
in 2023) to sustain sales of the Model 3 and Y (see Figure 5), which have nevertheless been stagnant over this
period.

As Tesla still represents over half of the total U.S. market for fully electric vehicles and 41% of the market for plug-in
vehicles, it is difficult for the U.S. market overall to rapidly expand when Tesla is flat or declining.

5. Addressing barriers to EV adoption and the outlook ahead

Taking a step back, consumer surveys find that about half of U.S. vehicle buyers are considering buying an EV
within the next 12 months, indicating substantial consumer interest and potential for market growth.13

Cost and charging-related concerns remain the most commonly cited barriers to consumer adoption.14 Both trends
are improving, thanks to both market competition and investment and supportive policy.

Today, outside the luxury vehicle segment (which is already at price parity), EVs in the massmarket compact SUV
and mid-size car segments are still roughly $10,000 more expensive to purchase than comparable internal
combustion vehicles (before any applicable tax credits or state incentives).15

Looking forward, battery prices continue to decline and competition is driving automakers to focus relentlessly on
lowering the cost of manufacturing.16 New more affordable EV models in the small crossover segment are also
coming to market, like the new 2024 Hyundai Kona EV (which starts at ~$32k), the 2024 Chevy Equinox EV
(starting MSRP ~$35k) and 2025 Volvo EX30 (starting at ~$36k).

15 The Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV retail for ~$30,000-$41,000, while the electric Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai
Ioniq 5 and Tesla Model Y are priced at roughly ~$42,000-$62,000 (though the entry level EV trims generally come
with more premium features than the entry trims of comparable ICE vehicles). Similarly, a Toyota Camry or Honda
Accord retails for ~$28,000-40,000 while a Tesla Model 3 or Hyundai Ioniq 6 is priced at ~$39,000-$56,000. See

cut-costs-push-turn-ev-business-profitable-memo-says-2024-05-16

Public charger networks are also expanding, helping address anxiety about charger access and electric vehicle
range. The U.S. added about 700 new public fast-charging stations in the 2nd Quarter of 2024, an increase of 9% in
three months, bringing the total to nearly 9,000 sites. The number of public fast-charging stations in the U.S. could
outnumber gas stations by 2032 or sooner, according to Bloomberg.17 The industry's convergence on the North
American Charger Standard (NACS) will also ensure that EV owners have access to the broadest possible network
of public fast-chargers. Companies will invest a collective $6.1 billion on North American charging infrastructure this
year, nearly double their 2023 investment18--and federal funds are helping pave the way.

The most important thing Congress can do now for the EV sector is to provide policy certainty and continuity. By
providing continuity and avoiding abrupt changes in policy conditions, Congress can create the right conditions for
America's dynamic automotive sector to invest, compete, and meet consumers' needs.

6. Is the U.S. grid ready for EVs?

All those EVs and chargers mean more demand for electricity, raising the question: is the U.S. grid prepared to
handle millions of new EVs?

To address this question, we need to take it in two parts and consider contributions of EVs to total electricity
consumption and peak electricity demand.

                                                                                                Page 6 of 7
            Senate Budget Committee Issues Testimony From Princeton University Assistant Professor

First, it is important to note that even as EV sales shares increase, the stock of EVs on American roads lags behind
sales. Only a portion of the overall U.S. automotive fleet turns over each year, with about 15-17 million vehicles sold
each year and a total fleet of just over 280 million vehicles.19 So while nearly 10% of new vehicles sold in recent
months were plug-in vehicles, only about 1% of the on-road fleet of light duty vehicles are electric today. Even if
100% of new vehicles sold were electric tomorrow, it would take about 15 years before the entire fleet of U.S.
vehicles is electrified--and it will take considerably longer than that given current trends. We thus have some time to
prepare America's electricity infrastructure, markets, and regulation for widespread EV adoption--but we best not
waste it.

REPEAT Project's 2024 Current Policies scenario -- which most closely matches (yet still exceeds) current EV
market trends -- expects EVs to consume about 322 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity by 2030 and 723 TWh by
2035, equivalent to about 8% and 17% of total U.S. electricity use today (Figure 7).20 Putting it another way, by
2035, electric vehicles could consume nearly as much electricity as is produced today by the nation's entire fleet of
nuclear power plants or all non-hydro renewables combined.

17 At the current pace, public fast-charging sites will outnumber gas stations in eight years, but the pace of charger
deployment is expected to accelerate.

While a lot of attention has recently been paid to increasing demand from data centers and AI, electric vehicles are
actually likely to be a larger driver of electricity demand growth over the coming decade.

Figure 7. Projected Electricity Demand From Battery Electric and Plug-In Hybrid

Electric Vehicles vs Current U.S. Electricity Generation

***

To ensure that EVs deliver the greatest emissions reductions, the U.S. needs to add substantial new clean
electricity generating capacity. Sustaining existing federal policies to support renewable electricity deployment and
retain (and uprate) nuclear power plants are thus paramount, as are efforts to reform permitting and accelerate the
construction of U.S. high voltage transmission networks.

It is important to note though that even when consuming today's average U.S. electricity mix, EVs produce about
80% less greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline vehicle and about 60% less than a comparable
hybrid21 -- and the mix of new generation added to the U.S. grid will be much cleaner than today's supply.
According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), 99% of new capacity expected to come online in the U.S.
over the next 12 months will be zero emissions generation or battery storage.22

Beyond contributions to overall electricity use, EV chargers also represent large new instantaneous power demands
that could contribute to stress on local and national grid infrastructure. Coming home and plugging an EV into a
typical Level 2 EV charger is like flipping the switch on a dozen or more window mounted air conditioners -- or
enough to roughly double or more the peak demand of a typical U.S. household. Poorly timed charging could
therefore put considerable strain on local grid equipment, particularly at the distribution level.

                                                                                                Page 7 of 7
            Senate Budget Committee Issues Testimony From Princeton University Assistant Professor

Fortunately, it should be possible to avoid charging EVs during periods of peak grid stress. An EV with ~300 miles
range has enough charge for a whole week's worth of average household driving, giving EV owners considerable
flexibility to decide not just what time of day but what day of the week to charge their vehicles. Assuming only a
modest level of flexible charging, REPEAT Project scenarios thus expect EVs to contribute 4% of peak U.S.

...electricity demand in 2030 and 7% in 2035 (vs ~8% and 13% of total annual electricity consumption,
respectively). Electric vehicles contribute ~41 gigawatts (GW) to a peak demand of 922 GW in 2030 and ~66 GW to
a peak demand of 975 GW in 2035 in this scenario.23 For comparison, the U.S. has ~506 GW of natural gas
generating capacity today and is expected to add nearly 17 GW of new battery storage capacity to the grid in the
next 12 months alone.24 Broader use of managed charging could further reduce (and nearly eliminate) the
contribution of electric vehicles to peak grid use.

It is thus critical to provide incentives for EV owners to participate in managed charging programs or "smart
charging" programs that smooth out the aggregate demand EV chargers put on the grid at any one time. By
charging during periods when distribution networks have ample spare capacity and electricity prices are lower, EV
owners should also enjoy significantly lower costs to fuel their vehicles.

The technology is available today to coordinate EV charging and avoid stressing our grid infrastructure; all that is
missing are appropriate regulatory reforms to retail rate design, demand response aggregation, and distribution
utility remuneration. While these reforms are the domain of state utility regulators, Congress could consider
measures to incentivize states to undertake these reforms, expand knowledge on best practices across the country,
and establish appropriate technical standards for smart charging.
