Washington, D.C. -- Senator Ted Budd (R-NC), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voted to
advance the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to the Senate floor.

Senator Budd secured a provision that fully prohibits the Air Force from divesting F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft at
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base through 2029.

The Air Force plans to divest 26 Strike Eagles from Seymour Johnson next year, even though aircraft from North
Carolina's 335th Fighter Squadron helped defend Israel by shooting down dozens of drones and missiles from Iran
in April. Additionally, these Strike Eagles have more than half their service life remaining and recently received
multi-million dollar upgrades to their radars and avionics.

Several top military officials have praised the F-15E after being questioned by Senator Budd in committee hearings.
Strike Eagles were called phenomenal, very capable, and critical for scenarios in the Indo-Pacific.

Senator Budd also secured several other significant wins for North Carolina, including a 4.5% pay raise for North
Carolina servicemembers and their families, more than $300 million in military construction projects, accelerating
production of Infantry Squad Vehicles, and investing in research and development at North Carolina companies and
educational institutions.

Senator Budd said in a statement:

"The Air Force's plan to divest F-15E Strike Eagles would harm our national security and shatter the Goldsboro
community. As was made clear in countless Armed Services Committee hearings this year, F-15Es are incredibly
capable aircraft that are unmatched in the fleet. I am thrilled that my colleagues agreed with me that divesting these
aircraft was a misguided decision by the Air Force. I'll continue to fight to ensure that the future of Seymour
Johnson is bright and our military remains strong.

"North Carolina is the proud home of eight military installations, a growing defense industry, and world-class
academic and research centers contributing to our national security. I am proud to support our men and women in

                                                                            Page 2 of 5

uniform by improving their quality of life and ensuring they have the facilities, equipment, and other tools necessary
to keep America a strong nation for decades to come. The investments we are making in our state and our military
are necessary to combat the growing threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and terrorists plaguing the Middle East
and coming across our border.

"It's important to recognize that this process is not over. The NDAA must still pass the Senate, conference with the
House, and be passed by both chambers again in its final form before the president signs it into law. I will continue
to fight for important investments to modernize the joint force and improve readiness and lethality, and oppose
highly problematic provisions, such as requiring women to register for the Selective Service. Any effort to draft our
daughters is simply wrong."
