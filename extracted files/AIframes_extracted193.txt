It would be bad enough if severe river flooding washed out roads and train tracks leading to a U.S. military
installation and interrupted transportation in and around the facility.

What if a foreign adversary took advantage of that natural disaster and launched a cyberattack in the area? How
quickly could recovery take place before national security was affected?

This is the sort of scenario Auroop Ganguly, director of AI for Climate and Sustainability and co-director of
Northeastern's Global Resilience Institute, and his interdisciplinary team are analyzing for a U.S. Department of
Defense-funded study on recovery from disruptions to critical infrastructure, both military and civilian.

Ganguly says the focus is on mapping failure and recovery pathways and adapting to changing conditions, which
include more extreme weather events as a result of climate change and evolving security challenges, including
terrorism and cyberattacks.

The study will pay particular attention to compounded threats, when the pressure of one disaster is made worse by
the co-occurrence of another.

"Recovery has to be efficient and effective. Not like what happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Even
now, the city is not what it used to be," Ganguly says.

"Our technology is getting so complicated, if one thing fails in the power grid, it can have cascading effects. That
has an impact on transportation, communication and water," he says.

                                                                           Page 2 of 2

"We have to make plans in advance for robustness and recovery," Ganguly says.

Northeastern is the lead researcher on the $3 million, five-year DOD project being conducted in collaboration with
the University of California at Berkeley, the Pacific Northwest National Lab, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
the U.S. Naval Research Lab.

The team is using network science and engineering to develop a theoretical framework for recognizing system
fragilities and putting recovery processes to work.
