Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, issued the following news release:

Today, congressional leaders released the second half of a bipartisan appropriations deal that will deliver billions in
federal funding for critical programs that benefit Hawai'i. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai'i), a senior member of
the Senate Appropriations Committee, successfully secured funding for Hawai'i's priorities in the final deal. The
newly released bills follow the passage of the first half of the spending deal, which included billions in federal
funding to improve roads and infrastructure, provide food and housing assistance for families, and support veterans,
among other key priorities.

"Billions of additional federal dollars are set to flow to Hawai'i. This new funding will help support the Native
Hawaiian community and provide people with health care, education, and other essential services," said Senator
Schatz, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

(FEMA) to report on the urgent need for temporary housing on Maui following last summer's devastating fires. It
also includes language calling on Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to reaffirm his commitment to not reutilize the
