positioning us to deliver even greater value. Our strategic plan entails reaching operational capacity of 300 MW by
the close of 2024 and scaling up to 550 MW by the conclusion of 2025.”

Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf’s Chief Financial Officer added, “In 2023, TeraWulf demonstrated exceptional operational
performance and expansive growth, resulting in record levels of revenue and profitability, as demonstrated by both

a substantial reduction in our debt of $40 million in the aggregate as of February 29, 2024, significantly bolstering
our financial standing. As of the end of February, our balance sheet reflects a fortified financial foundation, with $49
million in cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin. This substantial reduction in debt and enhanced liquidity position
underscores TeraWulf's resolute commitment to prudent financial management, positioning us even more securely
to capitalize on future opportunities with confidence.”

“As we look ahead, we're excited to leverage our highly efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to significantly
expand hash rate at our top tier sites,” added Nazar Khan, Chief Operating Officer of TeraWulf. “Additionally, we're
actively pursuing opportunities to optimize the utilization of our proprietary infrastructure and unlock additional
value, including the assessment of advanced AI and HPC applications.”

Full Year 2023 Operational and Financial Highlights

Key financial and operational highlights for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 include:
    •   Revenue increased 360% to $69.2 million in 2023, as compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2022 driven by
        increased bitcoin production and higher average realized bitcoin prices during the period.
    •   Gross profit increased 960% to $41.9 million in 2023, as compared to $4.0 million in fiscal 2022.
    •   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased by $64.9 million to $30.7 million in 2023, as compared to $(34.2)
        million in fiscal 2022.
    •   Reported cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $1.3
        million at fiscal year-end 2022.
    •   Net debt¹ at fiscal year-end 2023 declined 41% to $84.9 million, as compared to $144.7 million at fiscal
        year-end 2022. Net debt was reduced another 32% to $58.0 million as of February 29, 2024.

Additional non-GAAP metrics for fiscal year 2023, which include the impact of TeraWulf’s joint venture interest in
the Nautilus Cryptomine facility², include:
    •   Self-mining operating capacity increased by 464% to 7.9 exahash per second (“EH/s”) as of December 31,
        2023, as compared to 1.4 EH/s as of December 31, 2022.
    •   Self-mined bitcoin production increased 550% to 3,407 in 2023, as compared to 524 in fiscal 2022.
    •   Power cost averaged $8,676 per bitcoin self-mined, or approximately $0.032/kWh in 2023.

___________________________________¹ Net debt calculated as the outstanding principal balance of the
Company’s term loan less cash and cash equivalents.² The Company’s share of the earnings or losses from
operations at the Nautilus Cryptomine facility is reflected within “Equity in net loss of investee, net of tax” in the
consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine facility are not
reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of operations lines in TeraWulf’s consolidated statements of
operations. The Company uses these metrics as indictors of operational progress and effectiveness and believes
they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies.

Hash Rate Growth

In the fiscal year 2023, TeraWulf experienced significant growth, with its self-mining operating capacity reaching 7.9
EH/s by year-end, representing a more than quadruple increase from the 1.4 EH/s recorded at the end of 2022. As
of February 29, 2024, the Company had a self-mining hash rate of 7.5 EH/s, with a fleet of approximately 64,500
miners deployed. Among these, 48,500 miners are operating at the Lake Mariner facility, while the Nautilus
Cryptomine facility houses around 16,000 of the Company’s miners.

Further expansion is ongoing at the wholly owned Lake Mariner facility which is fueled by 93% zero-carbon power,
with the construction of Building 4 entering its final phase. This incremental infrastructure is expected to contribute
an additional 35 MW of capacity, raising TeraWulf’s total operational mining capacity across both sites to
approximately 10 EH/s.

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 10
                           TeraWulf Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results

With considerable room for expansion within its existing facilities, the Company reaffirms its commitment to
achieving an operational infrastructure capacity of 300 MW by the end of 2024. Additionally, it endeavors to deploy
550 MW, equivalent to approximately 28.3 EH/s, utilizing the current generation of miners by 2025. Continuously
evaluating the most profitable utilization of its energy and digital infrastructure, the Company is actively exploring
potential applications of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 360% to $69.2 million compared to $15.0 million in
fiscal 2022. The increase in revenue is attributable to a 550% increase in bitcoin production year-over-year
following the energization of Building 2 (50 MW) in June. Building 3 (45 MW) was subsequently completed in
December, bringing online capacity at the Lake Mariner facility to 160 MW.

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $41.9 million (61% of revenue), as compared to $4.0
million (26% of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $37.9 million (or 961%) resulting
from the aforementioned increase in operational capacity.

Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $71.3 million, as compared to $47.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cost of operations was primarily driven by higher depreciation
expense due to the increase in mining operations at the Lake Mariner facility in 2023.

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $30.7 million, as compared to a loss of
$34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2023, and February 29, 2024, the Company held $56.2 million and $49.1 million, respectively,
in cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin on its balance sheet. As of the same periods, the Company had
outstanding indebtedness of approximately $139.4 million and $106.0 million, respectively. The Company
anticipates an additional repayment of approximately $30.0 million during the first week of April, thereby reducing
the debt balance to $76.0 million.

Non-GAAP Measures

We have not provided reconciliations of preliminary and projected Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP
measure of net income/(loss) to common shareholders. Providing net income/(loss) to common shareholders
guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and
other non-core operating items that are included in net income/(loss) to common shareholders, including but not
limited to asset impairments and income tax valuation adjustments. Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure with
the most comparable GAAP measure for historical periods is indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared
upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance. Please reference the “Non-GAAP financial
information” accompanying our quarterly earnings conference call presentations on our website at
www.terawulf.com/investors for our GAAP results and the reconciliations of these measures, where used, to the
comparable GAAP measures.

Non-GAAP Measure

The Company presents adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s non-GAAP “Adjusted EBITDA”
excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-based
compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-
cash items that the Company believes are not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the
accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to
other companies; (iii) equity in net loss of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) costs related to non-routine
regulatory activities, which costs management does not believe are reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating
activities; (v) other income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes is not
reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; and (vi) gains and losses related to discontinued
operations that are not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The Company’s non-GAAP
Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on

                                                                                                              Page 9 of 10

the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net loss
of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in its ongoing operations as a result of
its investment in Nautilus.

Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these items allows for
meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies,
and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating
its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of
non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts
in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the
foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on
a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses
necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-
based compensation expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring
expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees,
officers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be
expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenue.

The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other
companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP
financial results differently. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under
GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating (loss) income or any other measure of
performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents adjusted
EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or
superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be
considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable to common stockholders) for the periods indicated (in thousands):
