Body


Inc. revealed today that Conti Federal Services, LLC ranks No. 1850 on the 2024 Inc. 5000, its annual list of the
fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most
successful companies within the economy's most dynamic segment-its independent, entrepreneurial businesses.

"Being recognized as one of the top 5000 fastest-growing private companies by Inc. is a tremendous milestone for
Conti Federal Services," shares Peter Ceribelli, Conti Federal Chief Executive Officer. "This recognition not only
highlights our team's hard work and dedication but also underscores our commitment to excellence and innovation
in the industry. We are immensely proud of this achievement and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as
we continue to grow and make a positive impact in building a better world."

The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating
inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year's top
5000 companies this year's Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three
years.

"One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list," says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc.
as editor-in-chief. "To see all of the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from
health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to
this year's honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over
the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce."

For more than 115 years, the Conti name has been synonymous with high quality work on high stakes construction
projects. Now in their 4th generation of ownership, Conti Federal has evolved into one of the top global contractors
serving the mission of the U.S. Federal Government on projects around the world.

"I cannot overstate how proud I am of our team to deliver this sustained rate of high growth while safely delivering
our projects to the highest quality standards. By fostering a culture that emphasizes a relentless commitment to
helping our clients meet their mission, we have solidified our reputation as industry leaders," expresses Ceribelli.

Methodology

Companies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2020 to 2023. To
qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2020. They must be U.S.-based,
privately held, for-profit, and independent-not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies-as of December 31,
2023. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for
2020 is $100,000; the minimum for 2023 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for
subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places.
