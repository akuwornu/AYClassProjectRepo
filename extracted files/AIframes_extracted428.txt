Rep. Gregory Murphy, R-North Carolina, issued the following news release:

Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D. applauds the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for
Fiscal Year 2025. This legislation authorizes $895.2 billion for national defense discretionary programs. It
represents an increase of $9 billion over the FY24 enacted level, while also saving taxpayers $34 billion by cutting
inefficient programs, obsolete weapons systems, and unnecessary Pentagon bureaucracy.

"I'm grateful the House has passed a strong annual defense bill that enables our military to effectively protect the
United States and global security," said Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D."I applaud my colleagues for their diligent
work and the inclusion of $295 million to fulfill funding requests I submitted for installations in North Carolina's 3rd
Congressional District. This legislation will improve the lives of our brave service members and their families,
advance our military's readiness, eliminate woke ideology that distracts from the Pentagon's mission, and deter our
adversaries from harming our country. In an increasingly dangerous world, and under President Biden's record of
appeasement, we must vigorously support our warfighters and their ability to defend America."

* 19.5% PAY INCREASE for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% PAY INCREASE for all other service
