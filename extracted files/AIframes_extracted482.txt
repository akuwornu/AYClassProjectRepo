SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- �Red Cat Holdings, Inc.�(Nasdaq: RCAT) (“Red
Cat”), a drone technology company integrating robotic hardware and software for military, government, and
commercial operations, announces a partnership with Sentien Robotics, a leader in autonomous drone fleet
logistics. The partnership will enable organizations using Sentien’s Hive UAS management platforms to deploy Teal
Drones as part of a larger autonomous drone swarming strategy for mobile and fixed-position land, air, and sea
defense and security operations.

The partnership between Red Cat and Sentien Robotics will enable the companies to provide warfighters with the
ability for continuous uninterrupted reconnaissance on enemy targets with drone swarms. Red Cat’s Teal Drones
recently successfully passed electronic warfare (EW) testing in Ukraine against some of the most powerful EW
counter UAV technology, and these battlefield-tested drones, coupled with Sentien’s fleet handling capabilities, give
warfighters tools and technology they have never had access to before.

“New technology is dramatically changing the nature of warfare, and those who can integrate defensive and
offensive assets across multiple domains and rapidly deploy those capabilities against adversarial targets will gain
tactical superiority,” said George Matus, Red Cat CTO. “This agreement with Sentien is a major step toward the
autonomous deployment and control of drone swarms from anywhere that can map, surveil and neutralize targets
where speed of data and lethal response across a network of connected systems are critical to modern combat
teams.”

Red Cat’s agreement with Sentien Robotics and integration with its Hive-Expedition and Hive-XL automated UAS
fleet transport and launch vehicles adds to its robust tactical ecosystem of partnerships with leading companies to

                                                                                              Page 2 of 3

provide the best solutions to clients for their tactical missions. Other Red Cat hardware and software partners
include Ocean Power Technologies, Primordial Labs, Tomahawk Robotics, Athena AI, Teledyne FLIR, Reveal
Technology, Immervision, and Doodle Labs, which enable capabilities such as computer vision, AI, and third-party
apps.

“Our goal with the Hive ecosystem is to enable a continuous, mission ready UAS presence from a single hub where
a single operator can deploy and control drones from anywhere,” said Brandon Borko, Sentien Robotics CEO. “We
want to provide rapidly scalable drone service areas that can be deployed to critical locations such as security and
disaster relief sites. In the future you won’t find a person behind a controller for every single drone. You're going to
have fleets of drones performing tasks, supporting humans on the ground, and they will all be flown from ground
automation hardware like the Hive.”

Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones builds its Teal 2 drone solutions, designed to support U.S. and allied military
operations, public safety organizations, and government agencies, at its South Salt Lake facility. Teal 2 is a cost-
effective, man-portable sUAS designed to “Dominate the Night™” that has best-in-class night vision, multi-vehicle
control support, and a fully modular design. It is both Blue UAS Certified and FAA Remote ID approved.

Sentien Robotics developed the Hive to automate all facets of UAS operation. The Hive features robotics
automation hardware and intelligence software to enable operations of fleets of UAS with the vision of reducing
manpower, improving safety, and vastly improving performance over traditional UAS operations. The Hive enables
new capabilities not available to tethered or ground launched UAS systems. The Hive Expedition and Hive-XL are
fully automated UAS fleet management platforms that support multiple drones and provide automated launch,
recovery, recharging capability, data download, precision landing, and storage.

About Red Cat, Inc.�� Red Cat (Nasdaq: RCAT) is a drone technology company integrating robotic hardware and
software for military, government and commercial operations. Red Cat’s solutions are designed to “Dominate the
Night™” and include the Teal 2, a small unmanned system offering the highest-resolution thermal imaging in its
class. Learn more at www.redcat.red.
