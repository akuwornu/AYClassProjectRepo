As you may recall, we started out 2023 with some of my Big Questions about what the year might hold for U.S. and
international economic policy. Since I like how that column aged in retrospect (see, e.g., my tepid skepticism of both
a U.S. recession and China rebound in 2023), we'll do the same this week, looking at big, open questions for this
yearquestions that, instead of playing pundit and confidently predicting an outcome, I'll gladly admit relative
ignorance as to how they'll turn out. (Yes, I know, this is why I'll never make it in politics.)

So let's get to it.

Soft" Landing Watch

Easily the biggest economic question in the United States last year was whether we'd fall into a recession. Back
then, a large majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and other reputable sources
saw a near" term recession as more likely than not, but a vocal minority predicted the much" fantasized, rarely
achieved "soft landing," whereby the Federal Reserve would tighten U.S. monetary policy just enough to cool labor
demand and other economic activity without the whole thing tipping into contraction.

Will we avoid a recession? Will China's recovery continue to fizzle? Is this the year for AI? And more.

After a string of upside surprises and no wobbles in various recession indicatorsespecially in the surprisingly strong
labor marketprofessional sentiment shifted dramatically. By December, most economists were optimistic that
inflation was (mostly) under control, that the United States would avoid a full" on recession altogether, and that the
Fed would aggressively cut interest rates this year (signaling that the worst of inflation is over and fueling economic
growth):

Wonks will continue to debate why, exactly, we avoided a hard landing (the interminable fight between Team
Transitory and Team Persistent over inflation's causes and future direction), and it's certainly worth considering
what last year's big miss says about the economic forecasting profession. (My take: Predictions are hard, especially

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 5
                                       SOME OF MY BIG 2024 QUESTIONS

coming out of a black" swan global pandemic.) But what really isn't up for debate today is that experts think the U.S.
economic outlook is better today than it was at this time last year.

This doesn't mean, however, that we're out of the woods entirely. The Fed and most economists might think things
look good, but others aren't nearly as sanguine. This most notably includes corporate CEOs, 72 percent of whom
told the business research organization the Conference Board last quarter that they were still planning for a
recession in the next 12 to 18 months:

Meanwhile, American consumers continue to spend, but they remain pretty sour on the state of the economy for the
same reasonsinflation, higher interest rates, etc.that we discussed in October. This "vibescession" may be ending,
in line with research showing that consumer sentiment lags inflation by several months, but it's not done quite yet.
(For those interested in the relationship between consumer sentiment and U.S. economic performance, check out
this fascinating new paper.)

Finally, the U.S. labor marketand thus, the U.S. economymight not be as strong as it first appears. For one thing,
the big driver of job growth in 2023 was "acyclical" industries that aren't reflective of the broader economy:

Many labor economists also are concerned that job openings data, which remain elevated versus pre" pandemic
levels, aren't accurate, and that both the string of downward revisions to the jobs figures (all but one month in 2023)
and recent declines in labor force participation indicate a cooler labor market than may first appear. For you data
nerds, part of the problem is the "complete disconnect" between the payroll survey (where we get the topline jobs
number) and the household survey (unemployment rate and participation). The latter is looking much more
pessimistic than the former:

Other data give more reasons for pause: The Institute for Supply Management surveys of services and
manufacturing managers have gotten much more pessimistic (see below); workers are quitting much less often
(typically what happens as recessions approach); and employers are hiring less, too.

None of this means that a big crash or even a mild recession is imminent (and I still tend to side with the Soft
Landing Crowd), but it does mean that we should probably hold off on turning Jay Powell's birthday into a national
holidayat least just yet.

What Will Happen to Commercial Real Estate and the Banks Supporting It?

Another reason to pause the soft" landing parade is also another big thing I'm watching closely in 2024: the
commercial real estate market. As the Wall Street Journal just reported, in fact, almost 20 percent of major metro
office space was vacant at the end of 2023a new record dating back to the late 1970s:

Much of this is, as we've discussed (and podcasted), driven by remote work, housing costs, and other quality" of"
life issues. Yet contrary to what you might think, the hardest hit commercial real estate markets today aren't in
expensive coastal metros like San Francisco, D.C., or New York (which have certainly struggled, too). They're
mainly in the South ("the three major U.S. cities with the country's highest office" vacancy rates are Houston, Dallas
and Austin, Texas") where the aforementioned post" pandemic issues fuel fires already burning from earlier
decades of commercial overbuilding and where they make a big turnaround less likely. As one real estate pro
explained, "The bulk of the vacant space are buildings that were built in the 1950s, '60s, '70s and '80s"and good
luck getting that space rented in today's still" strong remote work environment.

Converting these properties to much" needed residential housing could help with this problem (especially since
older properties are typically easier to convert), and conversions are popping up around the country. But not all
properties can be converted, and the ones that can likely need two big things: 1) buy" in from local regulators and
voters (to revise building codes, zoning rules, and other regulationssee this new paper for a glimpse at the
regulatory burden commercial properties face); and 2) a big haircut from current owners to make the conversion
numbers work without massive government subsidies. Here's one recent example of types of price cuts that may be
needed:

                                                                                                          Page 3 of 5
                                        SOME OF MY BIG 2024 QUESTIONS

This haircut is where the recession linkage may come in. While the U.S. commercial real estate market alone
(probably) isn't big enough to start a recession, a new paper provides an eye" opening look at how current
commercial weakness could infect the U.S. banking sector (emphasis mine):

Using loan" level data we find that after recent declines in property values following higher interest rates and
adoption of hybrid working patterns about 14% of all loans and 44% of office loans appear to be in a "negative
equity" where their current property values are less than the outstanding loan balances. Additionally, around one"
third of all loans and the majority of office loans may encounter substantial cash flow problems and refinancing
challenges. A 10% (20%) default rate on CRE loansa range close to what one saw in the Great Recession on the
lower endwould result in about $80 ($160) billion of additional bank losses. If CRE loan distress would manifest
itself early in 2022 when interest rates were low, not a single bank would fail, even under our most pessimistic
scenario. However, after more than $2 trillion decline in banks' asset values following the monetary tightening of
2022, additional 231 (482) banks with aggregate assets of $1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) would have their marked to
market value of assets below the face value of all their non" equity liabilities. To assess the risk of solvency bank
runs induced by higher rates and credit losses, we expand the Uninsured Depositors Run Risk (UDRR) financial
stability measure developed by Jiang et al. (2023) where we incorporate the impact of credit losses into the market"
to" market asset calculation, along with the effects of higher interest rates. Our analysis, reflecting market
conditions up to 2023:Q3, reveals that CRE distress can induce anywhere from dozens to over 300 mainly smaller
regional banks joining the ranks of banks at risk of solvency runs.

Numerous media reports show pressures at regional banks with substantial exposure to the commercial real estate
market, and bigger banks face similar (albeit smaller) risks: "Commercial property, and in particular mortgages on
less" full office buildings, had been one of the biggest factors pushing up problem debts." As the New York Times
reported earlier this year, moreover, "In its annual report released last week, the Financial Stability Oversight
Council a watchdog created in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis called commercial real estate the biggest
financial risk to the economy." How this all shakes out could go a long way to determining, deservedly or not,
whether future Jay Powell Days are happy or somber occasions.

Is 2024 the Year American Manufacturing Is Actually Great Again?

Last year was a bit of a weird one for U.S. manufacturing and industrial policy. On the one hand, there was a big
and undeniable increase in manufacturing" related construction across the countrya stat the Biden administration
and literally every Democratic partisan and industrial policy fan on the planet (I assume) cited constantly to show
that Biden had truly, finally made American manufacturing great again. Meanwhile, the actual U.S. manufacturing
sectori.e., the one actually producing stuff and hiring actual manufacturing (not construction) workersstruggled all
year, thanks to higher interest rates, continued materials inflation, worker shortages, economic uncertainty, tariffs
and trade disputes, and other headwinds. For example, the ISM's private survey of manufacturing purchasing
managers (aka the "PMI") just recorded its 14th straight month in contraction territory; the entire U.S. manufacturing
sector added a mere 12,000 jobs for all of 2023 (assuming December isn't also revised downward); output and
productivity are stagnant; and sentiment in the industryespecially for small and midsize firmswas below the
historical average:

We've thus been experiencing a sort of "two" tier" industrial economy. In Tier One, you have big companies in
industries preferred by the government (semiconductors, EVs, batteries, other renewables) and, to a lesser extent,
reshoring operations because of pandemic" related uncertainties. They're investing, more optimistic, and,
theoretically at least, poised to grow in 2024 and beyond. In Tier Two, however, you have existing U.S.
manufacturers, especially smaller ones and ones not targeted for government support, that are weaker and more
pessimistic.

As readers of this newsletter surely know, I'm skeptical that the trillions of U.S. industrial policy dollars and related
private investment will be worth the cost (i.e., that they'll generate thriving industries and broader economic growth,
not just a few random successes or obviously unrelated coincidences), and there are some clouds already on the
horizondelayed or canceled projects, grumbling politicians, unspent subsidies, regulatory obstacles, trade disputes,
etc. (You were warned.) Textbook criticisms of targeted subsidies and tariffs, moreover, have long cautioned

                                                                                                          Page 4 of 5
                                        SOME OF MY BIG 2024 QUESTIONS

thatespecially absent major supply" side liberalizationthese policies won't actually expand the economic pie but
instead simply redistribute existing resources (money, materials, manpower, etc.) at a net loss for the overall
economy.

But it's far too soon to boldly conclude this is all a bust: Federal funds will keep flowing to Tier One firms this year,
and some rate cuts and stronger growth might cure much of what ails the Tier Two guys. (It certainly won't be better
trade or immigration policy!) So, maybe the sector rebounds in 2024.

Regardless, you can rest assured I'll be here to cover it.

Speaking of fizzling rebounds ...

What's Next for China?

Since we just discussed China at length a few weeks ago, I won't belabor the issue too much today, but the future
of the world's second" largest economy is still important and uncertain for 2024. Since we last reviewed this in early
December, things in China remain a mess, with problem signs almost everywhere you look, including in the military:

Economic weakness in China not only means weakness abroad (e.g., for exporters and investors) but also
increased geopolitical uncertainty, as Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party
couldtheoretically, at leasttry to deflect local attention on widespread domestic problems by starting various
overseas shenanigans. (Though fortunately, all the "Taiwan invasion" stuff had cooled way downeven before the
latest military corruption scandals emerged.)

Instead of reversing course and reembracing markets, moreover, Xi is reportedly doubling down on the Marxism
and industrial policy (but I repeat myself! LOL). Both carry big risks: The former could further depress the Chinese
citizenry, foreign investors, and the economy more broadly; the latter can't fully offset domestic real estate,
consumption, and other economic problems, but it can ignite even more trade conflicts as subsidized overcapacity
reaches foreign markets and angers local politicians, many of whom are running for reelection in 2024.

As usual, I must caution that this doesn't mean China or the CCP will collapse anytime soon, and there are even
some tepid signs that the economy may have hit bottom. Regardless, it's a wildly important and uncertain situation
amplified by the U.S. elections, and thus makes for must" see" TV throughout 2024.

Will This Be AI's Earthquake Year?

This time last year, everyone was freaking outin good ways and badabout ChatGPT and other "artificial
intelligence" products that were acing human tests, making cool "original" art, and writing (superficially) impressive
prose in response to simple language "prompts." As we discussed in February, numerous reports warned that these
products would quickly usher in an era of mass joblessness and other sci" fi dystopias. In March, Elon Musk and
another 1,000 or so "tech leaders" were so rattled by AI that they openly called for a six" month moratorium on the
most advanced systems, warning that they present "profound risks to society and humanity."

Then ... nothing happened.

Ok, fine, not nothing: Last year, the technology continued to improve at a rapid clip, was increasingly adopted by
U.S. businesses, catalyzed some amazing scientific breakthroughs, and certainly destroyed some American jobs
(including fashion models!). However, the public" facing tech still has some problemssee, for example, this recent
analysis from Stanford economist Joy Buchanan and colleagues about GPT-4's continued "hallucinations" (e.g.,
fake citations) or this new image showing how AI image creators still suffer from basic spelling problems. AI is also
(predictably) helping to support U.S. companies and jobs, not just destroy them, because humans are quickly
adapting to incorporate the technology into their routines or to adjust their work to do things AI still can't do well.
And, of course, there are the not" insignificant facts that unemployment in the United States remains well below
historical averages, and thatnow almost four months since the AI moratorium would've endedthe techno"
apocalypse is nowhere in sight.

                                                                                                          Page 5 of 5
                                        SOME OF MY BIG 2024 QUESTIONS

AI technology thus appears to be following the same general trajectory as the earth" shattering ones before
itgradual, uneven advancement causing real" but" manageable disruptions thanks to good ol' human ingenuity and
adaptation. Will 2024 be any different?

What Will Happen in Argentina?

Finally, there's Argentina and the aftermath of this fall's shock presidential election victory of brash libertarian(ish)
economist Javier Milei.

When Milei first started gaining steam, I was of two minds. On one hand, Argentina's economy has long been a
statist disaster, and Milei was saying lots of good free" market things about how to turn things around. On the other
hand, the guy was ... umm ... quirky and saying lots other things that would give even an open" minded libertarian
like me serious pause. His election was, as my Cato colleague Ian Vasquez said at the time, itself a remarkable
accomplishment "articulating a clear, liberal alternative to Peronism with popular support and electoral success"but
governing was another story. Beyond his personality quirks, Milei was a political neophyte inheriting an economy in
crisis and a divided government full of bureaucratic enemies. He'll have his every move scrutinized by skeptical
media hoping to confirm anti" libertarian biases. And, as such, there remain plenty of reasons to worry that the
"libertarian government" in Argentina willfairly or notbecome a cautionary tale instead of a vindicating success.

However, there's a lot Milei can do without Argentina's legislature, and his early speeches, appointments and free"
market policy movesaka "economic shock therapy"have been mostly well" received by financial markets and wonks
(not just libertarians!) alike. Just this week scholars with the center" left Peterson Institute called Milei's early
movesdevaluing the currency, cutting spending and regulation, lifting price controls, slashing civil service jobs,
privatizing state" owned enterprises, liberalizing trade, and weakening unionsand his future plans "full of economic
and political risks" but seemingly offering "the maximum chances of success given the constraints he faces."

But, boy, are there big constraints and risks remaining. Beyond the economy's legacy problems and the inevitable
(promised) pain that reforms will inflict, strong resistance to Milei's agenda has unsurprisingly materialized. A court
last week, for example, suspended his sweeping labor reforms after the country's biggest union challenged it
(Milei's team will appeal), and protests have erupted in Buenos Aires. Many of his plans, especially dollarization,
remain unfinished and/ or dependent on legislative support. There's still a very long road to hoe.

Still, what's emerged so far is undeniably positive and unlike the chainsaw" wielding "Trump" like" caricature of Milei
we Westerners saw in the media before Argentina's presidential election. (Some of that caricature was undoubtedly
intentional by Milei, if only to attract attention.) I challenge you to watch this video from the indispensable Milei
Explains account on Twitter and not be blown away by both the discussion (substance and delivery) and the idea
that this guy is anything (hair" notwithstanding) like Donald J. Trump:

I honestly have no idea how Milei's time running Argentina will turn out. Parts of his agenda and persona still give
me pause. But it's not an understatement to say that his policy work in Argentina this year will be some of the most
relevantfor better or worsereforms undertaken anywhere in the world. Fingers crossed.
