"Rubrik is a leader in one of the fastest growing new segments in the cybersecurity market, data security, with a
total addressable market of about $53 billion by 2027*. The explosion of data especially with AI is creating a
massive market opportunity for Rubrik. The value we bring to our customers has resulted in subscription annual
recurring revenue up 46% year over year in Q1 to $856 million. While we are excited and proud of all the team has
done to date, we are in the very early innings of data security and look forward to continuing to build an enduring
company," said Bipul Sinha, Rubrik's Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Co-Founder.

Commenting on the Company's financial results, Kiran Choudary, Rubrik's Chief Financial Officer, added, "We are
pleased by the strong start to the year in Q1 with strength in large transactions driving net new Subscription ARR of
$72 million, up 32% year over year and Subscription ARR Contribution Margin up over 2,100 basis points year over
year. We are confident in our ability to deliver strong growth in Subscription ARR and continued operating leverage

    •   Subscription ARR Contribution Margin: Subscription ARR Contribution Margin was (11)% compared to
        (32)% in the prior year period, reflecting the improvement in operating leverage in the business.

    •   Net Loss per Share: GAAP net loss per share was $(11.48), compared to $(1.49) in the first quarter of
        fiscal 2024. GAAP net loss includes $630.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to

        public offering. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $(1.58), compared to $(1.48) in the first quarter of fiscal
        2024.

        quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the $20.6 million for employer payroll taxes due to the vesting of certain
        equity awards in conjunction with the initial public offering, free cash flow would have been $(16.5) million.

        and cybersecurity in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Rubrik is providing the following guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 and the full fiscal year 2025:
    •   Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Outlook:
        •    Revenue of $195 million to $197 million.

                                                                                                         Page 3 of 10
                           Rubrik Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results

        •    Non-GAAP Subscription ARR contribution margin of approximately (13.5)% to (12.5)%.
        •    Non-GAAP EPS of $(0.50) to $(0.48).
        •    Weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 179 million.
    •   Full Year 2025 Outlook:
        •    Subscription ARR between $983 million and $997 million.
        •    Revenue of $810 million to $824 million.
        •    Non-GAAP Subscription ARR contribution margin of approximately (12.5)% to (11.5)%.
        •    Non-GAAP EPS of $(2.35) to $(2.25).
        •    Weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 154 million.
        •    Free cash flow of $(115) million to $(95) million, including $23 million of one-time payroll taxes related
             to the public offering.

Additional information on Rubrik's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to their most
comparable GAAP measures, is included in the financial tables below. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance
measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort
due to the uncertainty of expenses that may be incurred in the future, although it is important to note that these
factors could be material to Rubrik's results computed in accordance with GAAP. For example, stock-based
compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are
impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of Rubrik's Class A common
stock, and Rubrik's future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant
change.

This press release and the related conference call contain express and implied "forward-looking statements" within

financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 and full fiscal year 2025, Rubrik's market position,
market opportunities, and growth strategy, product initiatives, go-to-market motions and market trends. In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect,"
"intend," "may," "might," "plan," "project," "will," "would," "should," "could," "can," "predict," "potential," "target,"
"explore," "continue," "outlook," "guidance," or the negative of these terms, where applicable, and similar

numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond Rubrik's control, that could cause actual results,
performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the statements.
Risks include but are not limited to Rubrik's limited operating history, the growth rate of the market in which Rubrik

                                                                                                           Page 4 of 10

expand internationally and its ability to utilize AI successfully in its current and future products. Additional risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements are included under the caption "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our most recent filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Rubrik's final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to
Rule 424(b), dated April 24, 2024. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made
and are based on information available to Rubrik at the time those statements are made and/or management's
good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Rubrik assumes no obligation to update forward-
looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Rubrik has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Rubrik uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that
use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating
results and trends and in comparing Rubrik's financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which
present similar non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP
financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with Rubrik's condensed consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Rubrik's historical non-GAAP financial measures
to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in
this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.

Free Cash Flow. Rubrik defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used
for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. Rubrik believes free cash flow is a
helpful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash
generated or used by Rubrik's operations that, after the investments in property and equipment and capitalized
internal-use software, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in Rubrik's business and
strengthening its financial position. One limitation of free cash flow is that it does not reflect Rubrik's future
contractual commitments. Additionally, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash used in operating activities and the
utility of free cash flow as a measure of Rubrik's liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase
or decrease in Rubrik's cash balance for a given period.

Non-GAAP Subscription Cost of Revenue. Rubrik defines non-GAAP subscription cost of revenue as subscription
cost of revenue, adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, and stock-
based compensation from amortization of capitalized internal-use software.

Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (Research and Development, Sales and Marketing, General and Administrative).
Rubrik defines non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses (research and development, sales and
marketing, general and administrative), adjusted for, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense.

Subscription Annual Recurring Revenue ("ARR") Contribution Margin. Rubrik defines Subscription ARR
Contribution Margin as Subscription ARR contribution divided by Subscription ARR at the end of the period. Rubrik
defines Subscription ARR Contribution as Subscription ARR at the end of the period less: (i) non-GAAP
subscription cost of revenue and (ii) non-GAAP operating expenses for the prior 12-month period ending on that
date. Rubrik believes that Subscription ARR Contribution Margin is a helpful indicator of operating leverage. One
limitation of Subscription ARR Contribution Margin is that the factors that impact Subscription ARR will vary from
those that impact subscription revenue and, as such, may not provide an accurate indication of Rubrik's actual or
future GAAP results. Additionally, the historical expenses in this calculation may not accurately reflect the costs
associated with future commitments.

Key Business Metrics

Subscription ARR. Rubrik calculates Subscription ARR as the annualized value of our active subscription contracts
as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on existing

                                                                                                          Page 5 of 10

terms. Subscription contracts include cloud-based contracts for Rubrik's subscription offerings and products sold on
top of its Rubrik Security Cloud ("RSC") platform, prior sales of CDM sold as a subscription term-based license with
associated support, and standalone sales of Rubrik's SaaS subscription products like Anomaly Detection
(previously known as Ransomware Monitoring & Investigation) and Sensitive Data Monitoring (previously known as
Sensitive Data Monitoring & Management).

Cloud ARR. Rubrik calculates Cloud ARR as the annualized value of its active cloud-based subscription contracts
as of the measurement date, based on Rubrik's customers' total contract value and, assuming any contract that
expires during the next 12 months is renewed on existing terms. Rubrik's cloud-based subscription contracts
include RSC and RSC-Government (excluding RSC-Private) and SaaS subscription products like Ransomware
Monitoring & Investigation (now known as Anomaly Detection) and Sensitive Data Monitoring & Management (now
known as Sensitive Data Monitoring).

Average Subscription Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate. Rubrik calculates Average Subscription Dollar-Based Net
Retention Rate by first identifying subscription customers ("Prior Period Subscription Customers") which were
subscription customers at the end of a particular quarter (the "Prior Period"). Rubrik then calculates the Subscription
ARR from these Prior Period Subscription Customers at the end of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the
"Current Period"). This calculation captures upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Prior Period. Rubrik then
divides total Current Period Subscription ARR by the total Prior Period Subscription ARR for Prior Period
Subscription Customers. Rubrik's Average Subscription Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate in a particular quarter is
obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior
three quarters.

Customers with $100K or More in Subscription ARR. Customers with $100K or more in Subscription ARR represent
the number of customers that contributed $100,000 or more in Subscription ARR as of period end.
