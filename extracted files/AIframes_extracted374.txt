In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly negatively influenced the space sector. Due to supply chain
disruption and production issues amidst government-enforced border restrictions, major              companies in the
satellite market saw an unheard-of decrease. Consumer business contracts and other agreements were suspended
as a result of this. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic had an       adverse effect on the key market growth in 2020
due to OEMs poor production rate and reduced procurement contracts. However, a number of nations are
removing the restrictions on trade and      travel and opening their borders, which has led to a sophisticated market.
The Artemis mission is once again being produced by NASA in 2021. The coronavirus outbreak that swept the
nation      caused the launch of India s first geo-imaging satellite (GISAT-1) to be postponed. It is the first earth
observation made by the nation.

Further, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has counted 6,542 artificial satellites orbiting the planet as of
January 2021, 3,372 of which are active spacecraft. Image, audio, & video data in the mode of analog and digital
signals are transmitted across numerous nodes in a network by artificial satellites. The Satcom industry has

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 5

changed as a result of the growth of mobile     satellites, low-Earth orbit (LEO), and the spread of reusable rocket
vehicles for commercial, military, and aerospace uses.

Market Dynamics:

Drivers-

The use of autonomous technology is based on cloud computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. These
innovations help to enhance flying operations. The military also uses autonomous      technology for various combat
activities and for managing the battlefield. Real-time data received from the systems actual locations are provided
by the sensors that have been installed in        them. It is further examined and put to use in tracking and health
monitoring systems. It comprises the effectiveness of parts and systems, MRO operations (Maintenance, Repair,
and Overhaul),         and route mapping and navigational needs. These would reduce operational costs while
increasing the overall efficiency of the corresponding systems.

Challenges:

Despite being a relatively recent phenomenon, cyber-security threats to satellite communication pose a serious risk
to the long-term viability of satellite systems. These mission-critical   vulnerabilities affect the communications,
launch systems, tracking and command, and telemetry systems. Such satellite communication aspects strongly rely
on trustworthy and secure               communication channels. Because satellite and cyberspace activities are
interdependent, it is crucial for international organizations to establish a legal standard that would safeguard
satellites and their communications. However, market expansion is hampered when transgressions of international
law take the form of cyber incidents that seriously harm satellite-based  communication.

Regional Trends:

In 2022, North America dominated the market. Increased government expenditure on military and government
communication networks is responsible for the expansion. Asia Pacific is predicted to   experience a considerable
CAGR during the projection period. Countries like China and Japan are significantly responsible for the contribution

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 5

and growth of this region. The rise of the    regional market over the anticipated period is attributable to the rising
use of satellite antennas in the communications, IT, aerospace, and automotive industries. Furthermore, because of
the      modernization of its infrastructure and the increase in travelers engaging in marine and coastal tourism,
Europe is anticipated to develop at the second-fastest rate. The proliferation of 5G         installations across the
country has also boosted the demand for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to offer backhaul networks for remote or
inaccessible locations. LEO spacecraft offer lower            latency in Satcom in addition to the technological
advancements in geostationary (GEO) satellites that enable high throughput and improved durability.

Recent Developments:
    •   In May 2023, VersaWave, a novel compact satcom system with 5G, has been introduced by Honeywell for
        the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) industries. VersaWave
        combines satcom, cellular (5G, 4G, 3G), Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity in a compact, lightweight device.
        These new connectivity features enable beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS)           communication for the
        AAM and UAS industries in a very tiny and lightweight device for its class of performance.
    •   In January 2022, The South Korean aerospace and defense business LIG Nex1 Co. Ltd and Thales Alenia
        Space, a collaborative venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), announced that      they had
        signed a contract for the supply of an advanced technology Digital Processor for the GEO-KOMPSAT-3
        communications satellite. An effective, fully reprogrammable digital processor that        combines
        transparent and regenerative signal processing via Digital Channelizer Units (DCU) and On-Board
        Processing Units (OBPU) sections, respectively, is part of the Ka-band Flexible           Broadband
        Communication System payload.
