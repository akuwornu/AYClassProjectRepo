DALLAS. TX, July 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InfStones, a leading global blockchain infrastructure
provider, today announced the successful launch of its Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) product, empowering emerging
protocols to jumpstart their DePIN projects while making sophisticated blockchain node operations accessible to
mainstream users.

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) are one of the fastest growing sectors in the industry due
to their ability to capture the value of real-world data and resources from a traditional physical infrastructure and
decentralize their control and ownership for a variety of use cases. Now, with InfStones’ innovative NaaS product,
designed to empower DePIN development, end users can easily set up their own nodes on a user-friendly platform
with just a few clicks and enjoy the same professional, hassle-free services offered to large institutions.

Since 2018, InfStones has been renowned for providing enterprise-grade node management services to industry-
leading institutions such as Binance, CoinList, and BitGo. By vastly lowering the technology barrier for individual
users to launch their own nodes on other protocols, InfStones’ NaaS product is accelerating the adoption of new
blockchain platforms and propelling the DePIN revolution.

InfStones’ Node-as-a-Service Product: One-stop dApp for DePIN Node Lifecycle

InfStones’ NaaS product enables end users to join and actively engage with innumerable DePIN communities,
allowing them to shape their futures and ensure their longevity while earning passive rewards. At the same time,

DePIN protocols can leverage the expansive market reach of InfStones’ NaaS product to rapidly source node
operators and increase adoption and engagement on their network, thereby accelerating the buildout of highly
scalable and decentralized infrastructure-as-a-service platforms.

For many DePIN projects, high upfront costs and complex node management have created significant barriers to
mass adoption. InfStones’ NaaS product solves this problem by providing end users with an intuitive dApp solution
similar to other popular Web3 dApps. When users use InfStones’ dApp, their experience is as simple and consistent
as using Uniswap or Lido. By simply connecting a wallet, users can begin operating a node with just a few clicks,
reducing time and resource investment to a minimum.



Behind the easy-to-use interface is InfStones’ industry-leading node management infrastructure, secured with 24/7
monitoring, disaster recovery, and AI-automated maintenance. InfStones’ robust node infrastructure has an
impeccable six-year track record and serves as the backbone for over 80 blockchain protocols and some of the
largest institutions in the industry, guaranteeing their uptime and safeguarding daily operations.

InfStones’ NaaS Product Brings Scaled Adoption to Aethir and Others

Aethir is a transformative cloud computing platform that optimizes the use of enterprise-grade GPUs through a
decentralized, scalable framework. In Aethir’s recent Node Sale, InfStones was selected as an official NaaS partner
and has since originated over 35% of the total Checker Nodes sold on the Aethir network, making InfStones one of
the largest node service providers on Aethir. As one of the first and most successful Node Sales, Aethir sold over
74,000 Checker Node licenses, attracting a broad user base.

By partnering with InfStones’ Node-as-a-Service product, Aethir has successfully converted over 26,000 of its
Checker Node license holders into long-term node operators. This has increased mass adoption and stability on its
network, helping Aethir achieve its vision of building a distributed cloud network and empowering node operators to
shape the future of Aethir.

Daniel Wang, Aethir Co-founder and CEO, said, "Partnering with InfStones has been crucial to our recent Aethir
Checker Node success. As our official partner, InfStones surpassed our expectations, deploying over 26,000 of our
network nodes and rapidly scaling Aethir's adoption, helping us move closer to full decentralization. This is a
testament to InfStones' service quality, long standing reputation, and broad market access."

In addition to Aethir, other groundbreaking DePIN projects such as CARV and Lumoz have also chosen InfStones
as their official NaaS provider. In these collaborations, DePIN pioneers at the intersection of gaming, AI, and
 modular computing are trusting InfStones to provide the scalability and security needed in their Web3
infrastructure.

Delivering Enterprise-grade Node Services to DePIN End Users

InfStones' excellent track record and trust from major institutions highlight the reliability and quality of its enterprise-
level node services. With the launch of its NaaS product, InfStones now offers the same enterprise-grade services
for DePIN end-users in a comprehensive one-stop platform, providing a smooth self-service node experience
without sacrificing reliability.

Dr. Zhenwu Shi, Founder and CEO of InfStones, said, "The launch of our innovative Node-as-a-Service product
marks an important milestone for us. For the past six years, we have already earned widespread recognition from
leading blockchain protocols and institutions for securing their network nodes. Now, we are offering DePIN end
users the same enterprise-grade tools deployed for institutions, allowing users to engage with the DePIN
community of their choice with a simple, intuitive UI and worry-free service. Our NaaS product will massively
expand our market reach and further strengthen our ability to partner with protocols to rapidly scale their networks,
unlocking new possibilities and enriching the Web3 ecosystem."
