PR NewswireMajor Fortune 100 Anchor Tenant Signed
Ameren Missouri Enables Delivery of Multi-Megawatt Power CapacityST. LOUIS, Aug. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --
TierPoint, a leading provider of secure, connected IT platform solutions that power digital transformation initiatives,
today announced its acquisition of a building in downtown St. Louis that it plans to transform into an enterprise-
grade data center through an investment of up to $150 million. A major Fortune 100 company has already signed
as an anchor tenant.

 "Missouri has recently seen tremendous data center activity throughout the state."The acquired building, located at
2300 Locust Street in St. Louis, Missouri, has 135,800 total square feet. Over the next year, the first phase of
investment will build out 22,600 square feet of data center production space, supporting up to 80 construction jobs
and nine permanent jobs at the facility. The first phase of the investment plan also calls for 5 Megawatts (MW) of
utility power, including 3 MW of critical load. Subsequent phases of the investment plan will build out additional
space in the building, scaling the facility over time to 20 MW of utility power (13 MW of critical load) and supporting
additional construction and permanent jobs."This major planned investment is a direct response to the exceedingly
strong demand we're seeing for data center services. It also demonstrates our commitment to the region and faith
in downtown St. Louis," said Jerry Kent, Chairman and CEO of TierPoint. "We want to especially thank the team at
Ameren Missouri for their above-and-beyond collaboration in finding a way to enable the power required for the
facility, to serve our anchor tenant and future customers. As elsewhere, we expect the new facility will be a landing
spot for large-scale, high-density colocation services required for artificial intelligence and other compute-
intensive, GPU-accelerated workloads.""The state of Missouri and the St. Louis region, in particular, are open for
business, and Ameren Missouri is excited to power growth in the data center industry," said Mark Birk, President of
Ameren Missouri. "We welcome TierPoint's expansion in downtown St. Louis and look forward to its plans to grow
even more in the years to come. Through our Smart Energy Plan, we've been able to attract businesses to the
region and help companies grow while providing reliable energy to meet the power needs of our customers today
and tomorrow." "Early in the process of sourcing locations for a new data center to answer growing demand, it was
readily apparent that the 2300 Locust Street building was an ideal candidate, given its location, size, structural
integrity, access to utility power and fiber routes," said Matthew Kent, Senior Vice President, Planning & Corporate
Development of TierPoint. "Backed by an amazingly capable data center operations team, our investment plan –
when completed – will give us a premier data center with the second largest critical load of all our facilities."

along with our robust electric, water, wastewater, and telecom infrastructure, make Missouri well-suited for large
data center investments," said Subash Alias, CEO of Missouri Partnership. "With the explosive growth of artificial
intelligence and cloud computing, it is clear that our time to win in this sector is now. We are excited to see
TierPoint make another strategic investment in Missouri like this one.""We know that revitalizing Downtown to make

need to rethink space to meet our future needs."The planned facility will join TierPoint's portfolio of 40 world-class
