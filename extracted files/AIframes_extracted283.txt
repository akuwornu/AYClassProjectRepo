ALEXANDRIA, Virginia, March 12 -- NEURALA, INC., Boston, Massachusetts has been assigned a patent (No. US
11928602 B2, initially filed May 9, 2018) developed by six inventors Matthew Luciw, Boston, Massachusetts;
Santiago Olivera, Brookline, Massachusetts; Anatoly Gorshechnikov, Newton, Massachusetts; Jeremy Wurbs,
Worcester, Massachusetts; Heather Marie Ames, Milton, Massachusetts; and Massimiliano Versace, Milton,
Massachusetts, for "Systems and methods to enable continual, memory-bounded learning in artificial intelligence
and deep learning continuously operating applications across networked compute edges."

Lifelong Deep Neural Network (L-DNN) technology revolutionizes Deep Learning by enabling fast, post-deployment
learning without extensive training, heavy computing resources, or massive data storage. It uses a representation-
rich, DNN-based subsystem (Module A) with a fast-learning subsystem (Module B) to learn new features quickly
without forgetting previously learned features. Compared to a conventional DNN, L-DNN uses much less data to
build robust networks, dramatically shorter training time, and learning on-device instead of on servers. It can add
new knowledge without re-training or storing data. As a result, an edge device with L-DNN can learn continuously
after deployment, eliminating massive costs in data collection and annotation, memory and data storage, and
compute power. This fast, local, on-device learning can be used for security, supply chain monitoring, disaster and
emergency response, and drone-based inspection of infrastructure and properties, among other applications.
