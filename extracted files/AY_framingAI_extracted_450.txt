PR NewswireCirata Data Migrator Reduces Replication and Migration Latency and Enhances Performance and
Scale for GPFS-Resident Data Assets Migrating to the CloudSAN RAMON, Calif., June 12, 2024 /PRNewswire-
PRWeb/ --Cirata, the company that automates Hadoop data transfer and integration to modern cloud analytics and
AI platforms, today announced new support for IBM® General Parallel File System (GPFS™), a cluster file system
used as storage for IBM Spectrum Scale data lakes. The new Live GPFS support, which is included in the recent
release of Cirata Data Migrator 2.5, dramatically reduces latency between storage changes and replication or
migration outcomes while also enhancing the performance and scale of GPFS-resident data assets migrating to the
cloud."Cirata Data Migrator gives organizations leveraging GPFS-resident data assets the confidence that they can
flexibly migrate and replicate data with high performance and control to nearly any target, anywhere."According to
Gartner®, "81% of respondents in organizations using public cloud said their organizations were using more than
one cloud service provider (CSP)." "As the number of CSPs an organization uses increases, the complexity of
managing them also increases. This can have negative consequences, such as performance issues associated
with data latency, unplanned cost overruns or data egress fees, and difficulties with data integration."1Cirata Data
Migrator lowers data latency while enhancing data migration performance for better data integration outcomes.

The new Cirata Live GPFS capability initiates data transfer from a source GPFS file system as changes occur,
without disruption to the storage environment. Ideally suited for cloud migrations, disaster recovery processes and
continuous data migration use cases, Cirata Data Migrator with Live GPFS not only improves migration scale and
performance but also supports fine-grained control and audit logging for assured compliance in increasingly
multicloud data management environments."Modern multicloud workloads require high performance access to a
common set of data to support scale-out storage and high availability. This is performed by IBM GPFS with great
efficiency," said Paul Scott-Murphy, Chief Technology Officer, Cirata. "By supporting this valued IBM GPFS
capability as a Live source, Cirata Data Migrator gives organizations leveraging GPFS-resident data assets the
confidence that they can flexibly migrate and replicate data with high performance and control to nearly any target,
anywhere."Cirata Data Migrator with Live GPFS delivers the following benefits:Reduces latency: By taking action
immediately after change, Cirata Data Migrator minimizes the latency between source storage modifications and
the actions to transfer or modify content at the targets. This can minimize recovery point objectives (RPO), and
assist in architecting solutions with zero recovery time objectives (RTO).Improves scale: Cirata Data Migrator
avoids the need to repeatedly scan a source file system to identify change when Live migration is in effect. This is
particularly beneficial for systems with very large numbers of storage items, allowing vastly more scalable outcomes
and minimizing the overhead imposed on storage.Enhances performance: By avoiding the need to repeatedly scan

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 2

source storage, Cirata Data Migrator with Live GPFS avoids an entire class of overhead that solutions relying on
scheduled jobs incur. The result is higher performance, and reduced computational overheads.Enables finer
control: Cirata Data Migrator offers fine-grained control of which data assets participate in migration. The Live
GPFS feature incorporates these mechanisms natively, so that techniques like path mapping and pattern-based
exclusion of file system content are incorporated into the core processing performed during data transfer, exposing
all of the fine-grained selectivity directly to users if wanted.Delivers auditable, accurate outcomes: Every action
taken in response to changing source data is logged in auditable form, complementing the detailed reporting
already available from migration verification to help ensure that migration outcomes are complete and
accurate.Cirata Data Migrator is a fully automated solution that automates Hadoop data transfer and integration and
moves on-premises HDFS data, Hive metadata, local filesystem, or cloud data sources to any cloud or on-premises
environment, even while those datasets are under active change. Cirata Data Migrator requires zero changes to
applications or business operations and moves data of any scale without production system downtime, business
disruption, and with zero risk of data loss. Migration targets supported include the Hadoop Distributed File System,
Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service, Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2, Google Cloud Storage, IBM
Cloud Object Storage and Oracle Object Store.Cirata Data Migrator 2.5 is available now including Live GPFS
support. For more information, visithttps://cirata.com/products/data-migrator-for-hadoop.1 Gartner, How to Optimize
