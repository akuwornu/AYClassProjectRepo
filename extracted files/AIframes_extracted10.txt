RPM International Inc. (NYSE: RPM), a world leader in specialty coatings, sealants and building materials, today
reported record financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter ended November 30, 2023.

"For eight consecutive quarters, we have generated record sales and adjusted EBIT, and we are making good
progress toward achieving our MAP 2025 profitability goals by becoming a more efficient and collaborative
organization. At our investor day last year, we discussed two other key components of MAP 2025 - improving cash
flow conversion and investing to accelerate organic growth. We have made great progress with cash flow, as our
$767.8 million cash from operating activities through the first six months of fiscal 2024 has already exceeded our
previous 12-month fiscal year record. Our organic growth investments are yielding successes, particularly in high-
performance buildings and turnkey flooring systems, where we are gaining share," said Frank C. Sullivan, RPM
chairman and CEO.

"Our Construction Products Group and Performance Coatings Group, the segments focused on coatings and high-
performance buildings, led growth in the second quarter. They benefited from their focus on maintenance and
repair, as well as their positioning to sell highly engineered solutions into growing end markets. Demand in DIY and
specialty OEM markets remained weak; however, we overcame these challenges by successfully executing MAP
2025 initiatives to expand gross margins by 320 basis points and generate double-digit adjusted EBIT growth."

Fiscal 2024 sales were a second-quarter record and were in addition to strong growth in the prior-year period when
sales increased 9.3%. Pricing was positive in all segments as they catch up with cost inflation. Volume growth was
strongest in businesses that were positioned to serve solid demand for infrastructure, reshoring and high-
performance building projects with engineered solutions, which was more than offset by lower DIY consumer
takeaway at retail stores and weak demand from specialty OEM end markets.

Geographically, sales growth was strongest in markets outside the U.S. A new management team and focused
sales strategy in Europe contributed to 8.9% growth, and Africa/Middle East and Asia/Pacific benefited from
improved coordination under PCG management that resulted in 13.0% and 6.4% sales growth, respectively.

Sales included a 0.3% organic decline, a 0.2% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions, and 0.5% growth from
foreign currency translation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to incentives to sell higher-margin products and
services; investments to generate long-term growth; and inflation in compensation, benefits and healthcare
expenses. These increases were partially offset by expense reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2023.

Fiscal 2024 second-quarter adjusted EBIT was a record and in addition to strong growth in the prior-year period
when adjusted EBIT increased 36.4%. This growth was driven by gross margin expansion of 320 basis points,
aided by MAP 2025 initiatives, including the commodity cycle, a positive mix from shifting toward higher margin
products and services, and improved fixed-cost leverage at businesses with volume growth.

CPG achieved record second-quarter sales with strength in concrete admixtures and repair products as a result of
increased demand for engineered solutions serving infrastructure and reshoring-related projects, as well as market
share gains. Businesses serving high-performance building construction and renovation also performed well.

                                                                                                                  Page 3 of 15
                               RPM Reports Record Fiscal 2024 Second-Quarter Results

Demand in markets outside the U.S. was strong and was driven by infrastructure-related demand in Latin America
and a more focused sales strategy in Europe.

Sales included 6.1% organic growth, 0.6% growth from acquisitions, and 1.4% growth from foreign currency
translation.

Record second-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by the positive impact of MAP 2025 initiatives, favorable mix, and
improved fixed-cost leverage from volume growth. Variable compensation increased as a result of improved
financial performance and was partially offset by expense reduction actions implemented at the end of fiscal 2023.

PCG generated record second-quarter sales, which were in addition to strong results in the prior-year period, driven
by growth in engineered turnkey flooring systems serving reshoring capital projects and market share gains. Strong
growth in Asia/Pacific and Africa/Middle East, which were all recently aligned under PCG, also contributed to the
record sales.

Sales included 5.6% organic growth, a 0.5% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions, and no impact from
foreign currency translation.

All-time record adjusted EBIT was driven by sales growth, favorable mix and improved fixed-cost leverage that was
enhanced by MAP 2025 initiatives. The adjusted EBIT growth was achieved in addition to strong results in the prior-
year period.

                               RPM Reports Record Fiscal 2024 Second-Quarter Results

SPG's second-quarter sales decline was driven by weak demand in specialty OEM end markets, particularly those
with exposure to residential housing. Sales were also negatively impacted by the divestiture of the non-core
furniture warranty business in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and challenging comparisons in the prior-year period
when the disaster restoration business had strong results in response to Hurricane Ian. Higher selling prices
partially offset this sales decline.

Sales included a 14.6% organic decline, a 2.7% reduction from divestitures, and 0.7% growth from foreign currency
translation.

Adjusted EBIT was negatively impacted by the sales decline and unfavorable fixed-cost leverage. The divestiture of
the non-core furniture warranty business also contributed to the adjusted EBIT decline. Investments in long-term
growth initiatives weighed on adjusted EBIT margins and were partially offset by expense-reduction actions in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.

Adjusted EBIT excluded a $4.0 million expense related to an adverse legal ruling for a divested business.

The Consumer Group's second-quarter sales decline was driven by reduced DIY takeaway at retail stores as
housing turnover hit multi-year lows and consumers focused their spending on travel and entertainment, as well as
certain retailers destocking inventories. These pressures were partially offset by market share gains, strength in
international markets, and higher pricing to catch up with inflation. The Consumer Group faced challenging
comparisons to the prior-year period when sales grew 15.3%.

Sales included a 5.1% organic decline, no impact from acquisitions, and foreign currency translation headwinds of
0.1%.

Record second-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by gross margin expansion enabled by MAP 2025 initiatives and
strength in international markets. This growth was in addition to strong prior-year results when adjusted EBIT
increased 180.3%.

Cash Flow and Financial Position

During the first six months of fiscal 2024:
    •    Cash provided by operating activities was $767.8 million, which exceeded the previous 12-month fiscal
         year record, compared to $190.9 million during the prior-year period, and included an all-time quarterly
         record of $408.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was driven by increased
         profitability and improved working capital management, including MAP 2025 initiatives.
    •    Capital expenditures were $89.3 million compared to $113.5 million during the prior-year period, driven by
         the timing of investments, including those related to MAP 2025 initiatives, which are expected to accelerate
         in the second half of fiscal 2024.

                                                                                                       Page 5 of 15
                             RPM Reports Record Fiscal 2024 Second-Quarter Results

    •   The company returned $138.3 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases and
        achieved its 50th consecutive year of dividend increases.

As of November 30, 2023:
    •   Total debt was $2.25 billion compared to $2.84 billion a year ago, with the $592.4 million reduction driven
        by improved cash flow being used to repay debt.
    •   Total liquidity, including cash and committed revolving credit facilities, was $1.51 billion, compared to
        $880.0 million a year ago.

Business Outlook

"We expect business conditions in the third quarter to generally be similar to the second quarter, with strength in
our CPG and PCG segments, international markets, and market share gains offsetting continued weakness in DIY
and specialty OEM demand. Adjusted EBIT growth is expected to accelerate, driven by less challenging prior-year
comparisons and MAP 2025 benefits, which should more than offset lower volumes in certain businesses and
investments we are making to accelerate future growth and efficiencies," Sullivan added. "For the remainder of the
year, we are leveraging our focus on repair and maintenance; our strong position serving demand for infrastructure,
high performance buildings and reshoring projects; and MAP 2025 to deliver another year of record sales and
adjusted EBIT."

The company expects the following in the fiscal 2024 third quarter:
    •   Consolidated sales to be flat compared to prior-year record results.
    •   CPG sales to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record results.
    •   PCG sales to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record results.
    •   SPG sales to decrease in the mid-teen percentage range compared to prior-year record results.
    •   Consumer Group sales to decrease in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record
        results.
    •   Consolidated adjusted EBIT to increase 25% to 35% compared to prior-year record results.

The company expects the following in the full-year fiscal 2024:
    •   Consolidated sales to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record
        results. The previous outlook was for mid-single-digit percentage growth.
    •   Consolidated adjusted EBIT to increase in the low-double-digit to mid-teen percentage range compared to
        prior-year record results. This outlook is unchanged from the prior outlook.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

To supplement the financial information presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States ("GAAP") in this earnings release, we use EBIT, adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share,
which are all non-GAAP financial measures. EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes, with
adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share provided for the purpose of adjusting for one-off items impacting
revenues and/or expenses that are not considered by management to be indicative of ongoing operations. We
evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before income taxes, but also look to EBIT as a
performance evaluation measure because interest income (expense), net is essentially related to corporate
functions, as opposed to segment operations. For that reason, we believe EBIT is also useful to investors as a
metric in their investment decisions. EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than,
income before income taxes as determined in accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest and
investment income or expense in determining operating performance, which represent items necessary to our
continued operations, given our level of indebtedness. Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful
to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that
this measure is critical to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also
evaluate EBIT because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing. Our underwriters
and bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt
underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be
predictive of potential future results. See the financial statement section of this earnings release for a reconciliation
of EBIT and adjusted EBIT to income before income taxes, and adjusted earnings per share to earnings per share.
We have not provided a reconciliation of our third-quarter fiscal 2024 or full-year fiscal 2024 adjusted EBIT
guidance because material terms that impact such measure are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably
predicted, and therefore a reconciliation of such measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

(     EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes, with Adjusted EBIT provided for the purpose of
c     adjusting for items impacting earnings that are not considered by management to be indicative of ongoing
)     operations. We evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before income taxes, but
      also look to EBIT, or adjusted EBIT, as a performance evaluation measure because Interest Income
      (Expense), Net is essentially related to corporate functions, as opposed to segment operations. For that
      reason, we believe EBIT is also useful to investors as a metric in their investment decisions. EBIT should not
      be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, income before income taxes as determined in
      accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest and investment income or expense in
      determining operating performance, which represent items necessary to our continued operations, given our
      level of indebtedness. Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income
      investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that this measure
      is critical to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also evaluate EBIT
      because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing. Our underwriters and
      bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt
      underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to
      be predictive of potential future results.
