ALEXANDRIA, Va., March 13 -- United States Patent no. 11,928,602, issued on March 12, was assigned to
Neurala Inc. (Boston).

"Systems and methods to enable continual, memory-bounded learning in artificial intelligence and deep learning
continuously operating applications across networked compute edges" was invented by Matthew Luciw (Boston),
Santiago Olivera (Brookline, Mass.), Anatoly Gorshechnikov (Newton, Mass.), Jeremy Wurbs (Worcester, Mass.),
Heather Marie Ames (Milton, Mass.) and Massimiliano Versace (Milton, Mass.). According to the abstract* released
by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "Lifelong Deep Neural Network (L-DNN) technology revolutionizes Deep
Learning by enabling fast, post-deployment learning without extensive training, heavy computing resources, or
massive data storage. It uses a representation-rich, DNN-based subsystem (Module A) with a fast-learning
subsystem (Module B) to learn new features quickly without forgetting previously learned features.

Compared to a conventional DNN, L-DNN uses much less data to build robust networks, dramatically shorter
training time, and learning on-device instead of on servers. It can add new knowledge without re-training or storing
data. As a result, an edge device with L-DNN can learn continuously after deployment, eliminating massive costs in
data collection and annotation, memory and data storage, and compute power. This fast, local, on-device learning
can be used for security, supply chain monitoring, disaster and emergency response, and drone-based inspection
of infrastructure and properties, among other applications." The patent was filed on May 9, 2018, under Application
No. 15/975,280. *For further information, including images, charts and tables, please visit:
