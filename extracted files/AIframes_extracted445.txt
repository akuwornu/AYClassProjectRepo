SAN MATEO, Calif., June 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Backblaze, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLZE), the cloud storage
innovator providing a modern alternative to traditional cloud providers, today announced a new partnership with
Active Cyber Insurance provider Coalition to help businesses proactively reduce their cyber risk. The partnership
provides Coalition’s customers with direct access to Backblaze Computer Backup, an enterprise-grade, unlimited,
and automatic endpoint backup solution, via the Coalition Control® cyber risk management platform.

Many businesses have gaps in their cyber security posture that disqualify them from cyber insurance coverage,
especially when it comes to immutable, off-site backups. With ransomware continuing to rise over 15% (FY '22 to
FY ’23) and the average ransomware demand increasing to nearly $1.4m, cyber insurance has become
increasingly important for risk mitigation. Businesses of all sizes need access to reliable backups to gain adequate
coverage and better secure their most valuable data. “Adding Backblaze’s industry-leading cloud backup as the
recommended backup solution in Coalition Control will help our customers improve their business continuity plans
and cyber incident remediation through reliable data backups,” said John Roberts, General Manager, Security, at
Coalition. “Backblaze’s accessible solution delivers businesses a win-win with increased compliance and enhanced
incident preparedness.”

Backblaze Computer Backup combines simplicity—including preconfigured installers for faster “time to security,”
backing up all user data by default, and predictable pricing for unlimited capacity—with available enterprise
administration features that businesses need to protect business-critical data across hundreds or thousands of
workstations—including fine-grained access controls, OIDC authentication support tools like for Azure AD and Okta,

and advanced backup lockdown and recovery settings.“Partnering with Coalition means we can take another step
forward in making data protection and disaster recovery accessible to businesses of any size,” said Elton Carneiro,
Senior Director, Partnerships, at Backblaze. “We are excited to work with experts in cyber insurance to play our part
in bolstering protection against threats and shoring up compliance.”

Coalition supplies policyholders in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom with access to
industry-leading cyber security tools through its cyber risk management platform, Coalition Control®. Insurance
products offered by Coalition help over 80,000 customers face rapidly evolving digital risk with comprehensive
cyber insurance coverage.
