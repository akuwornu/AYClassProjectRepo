COMMENTS BY CEO, ALI TAHA KOÇ, PhD

2023 was a year in which Türkiye's agenda was shaped by the February earthquake that came to be known as the
disaster of the century, the general election period, and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Globally, the main
impacts came from decelerated growth due to central banks' continued tightening policies, ongoing wars creating
humanitarian crises, and the effects of climate change. Despite these challenges, I am proud to share with you our
determination to further strengthen Türkiye's pioneering position on the journey of digital transformation.

During this time, we continued to enhance our technological infrastructure, know-how, and capabilities to provide
our customers with a seamless and high-quality communication experience. We aim to develop new strategies to
increase Türkiye's digital access and make technology more inclusive. With our projects supporting digital
transformation in various fields, from education and healthcare to business and social life, as Türkiye's Turkcell, we
continue to invest in the development of the technology sector and the future of our country.

Yet another year highlighted by prominent achievements...

We completed the year 2023 with a performance that exceeded our expectations. In 2023, according to inflation
accounting practices*, our consolidated revenues rose 14.6% to TRY107.1 billion, thanks to the expanding
subscriber base, sequential price adjustments, and contributions from our techfin business and digital services.
Consolidated EBITDA1 rose by 19.9% to TRY43.9 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 41.0%. Meanwhile, net income
increased by 82.5% year-on-year to TRY12.6 billion.

In 2023, while maintaining our leadership in the mobile segment, we remain committed to our rational pricing
strategy, despite the aggressive short-term campaigns of our competitors. This approach enabled us to maintain
our dynamic position in the industry. Moreover, thanks to our customer-oriented strategy, innovative and
comprehensive offerings, large sales network strengthened by digital channels, and best-in-class infrastructure, we
had 799 thousand net subscriber additions. This year, we maintained our focus on postpaid subscribers, ensuring a
higher revenue growth contribution, and gained a net 1.6 million subscribers. On the fixed broadband side, while
focusing on penetration with our fiber product, we also remained focused on revenue growth. By extending our end-
to-end fiber service to an additional 386 thousand home passes in 2023, the total number of households reached
rose to 5.8 million. Our fiber subscribers reached 2.3 million.

Our strategic focus areas continue to support growth

We continued our digital service portfolio activities, comprising significant brands such as BiP, TV+, lifebox, fizy,
GAME+, and digital advertising. In 2023, the number of stand-alone paid users2 enjoying our digital services
increased by 9% year-on-year to 5.6 million.

In 2023, Digital Business Services remained the primary supporter of corporate customers on their digital
transformation journey. In addition to end-to-end tailored digitalization services, data centers and cloud services
were the key contributors to revenue growth. We have completed over 3,500 projects in system integration and
managed services to date; the backlog from system integration projects has reached TRY3.1 billion. In the digital
data era, we consider the ownership of data, the raw material of industrial transformation, remaining in our country
to be an important initiative. To keep Türkiye's data within the country, we are committed to retaining our leadership
position in the data center market. We intend to further bolster our investments, having already allocated EUR330
million since inception.

                                                                                                    Page 5 of 17
   Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri : Full Year 2023 Results Achieving Double-digit Real Growth; Guidance Exceeded

Our techfin services, Financell3 and Paycell, continued their operations successfully in 2023. Financell, continuing
to diversify its product portfolio according to the financing needs of individual and corporate customers, had reached
a credit portfolio of TRY6.2 billion by the end of 2023. Paycell, with its extensive product portfolio that provides fast
and secure payment solutions, had reached 8.0 million users by the end of 2023. While the "Pay Later" service,
which constitutes a significant portion of Paycell's revenues, remains the key vertical driving growth, POS solutions,
which have been rapidly expanding since the last quarter of the previous year, have also supported Paycell's
growth.

We are shaping the future with our sustainability vision

As per our sustainability strategy, we aim to positively impact our environment, society, business, and planet in all
our endeavors. Therefore, as a leading company in the technology and telecommunications sector, we integrate
sustainability into our business strategy and operations. In this context, we don't just consider our investment in
renewable energy an environmentally friendly step but also an essential element in managing our energy needs. In
addition to our wind energy power plant, our solar energy plant projects, which will have an installed capacity of 300
MW, along with greenfield and rooftop solar power installations, we are confidently moving towards a future where
we expect to meet 65% of our energy needs from our renewable energy sources in 2026. This brings us one step
closer to our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. These investments enhance our environmental
sustainability while making our business model more competitive and sustainable.

In addition to these efforts, as Turkcell, we greatly emphasize social investment projects to ensure equal
opportunities for all segments of our society, utilizing the inclusive power of digitalization. We carry out projects that
prioritize social benefit, promote digital literacy, raise awareness about the conscious use of technology, and enable
participation in various aspects of life for many groups, from children to young people and from the elderly to
individuals with disabilities.

While supporting environmental sustainability with our renewable energy investments, we aim to add value to all
institutions and businesses through digital transformation. This dual approach brings us closer to our goal of
becoming a net-zero company and strengthens the social integration and inclusivity of technology. In the coming
periods, through the steps we will take towards environmental and social sustainability, we believe that as Turkcell,
the leading telecommunication and technology company, we will shape Türkiye's Digital Century.

Turkcell means Technology

Meanwhile, our approach to artificial intelligence technologies strikes a delicate balance between fostering
innovation and prioritizing societal benefit. We are fully confident that, in line with this strategy, we will play a critical
role in shaping the future. As Turkcell, we effectively integrate artificial intelligence solutions into every aspect of
our operations while ensuring the ethical use of AI in our actions. The chatbot that we have developed, supporting
around 200 thousand customers per day, provides a tangible example of how these technologies can be
implemented in business models. Additionally, we have AI-supported recommendation systems on our fizy and TV+
platforms, enhancing our capacity to provide content tailored to users' preferences. Furthermore, Turkcell's
artificial intelligence team has played a significant role in developing the 'In-Car Face Detection, Recognition, and
Analysis System' for Turkiye's domestic pride, Togg, the Turkish EV. These projects epitomize how technology
transforms our business processes and contributes to social benefit.

We aim to elevate Turkcell's strongest and most significant capability, the best-in-class mobile and fixed network
infrastructure, to the next level, focusing on increasing FTTS (Fiber to the Site) and modernizing through GPON
(Gigabit Passive Optical Network) in the upcoming period. We continue to take determined steps towards being the
best in the technologies of 5G and beyond. In this context, alongside our network preparations, we are increasing
R&D collaboration with our business partners.

In 2024, we expect4 high-single-digit growth in Group revenues, an EBITDA margin of around 42%, and the
operational capex over sales ratio5 of around 23%.

                                                                                                    Page 6 of 17
   Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri : Full Year 2023 Results Achieving Double-digit Real Growth; Guidance Exceeded

In the upcoming periods, our determination to carry Turkcell and our country to a brighter future with a focus on
innovation and our spirit of excellence will continue uninterrupted, positioning Turkcell as the pioneer of Türkiye's
Digital Century.

I express my gratitude to our Board of Directors, colleagues, customers, and shareholders who have been by my
side throughout this successful journey. Together, I am fully confident that we will achieve further success.

Revenue of the Group grew by 14.6% year-on-year in FY23. This growth is attributable to the expanding customer
base of Turkcell Türkiye driven by the postpaid subscriber base, and price adjustments. Additionally, revenue
growth was supported by our techfin business and digital services.

For the full year, Turkcell Türkiye revenues, comprising 86% of Group revenues, grew 18.0% to TRY91,953 million
(TRY77,952 million).

- Consumer business rose4 18.7% driven mainly by subscriber net additions both in mobile and fixed segments,
price adjustments and upsell efforts.

- Corporate revenues4 rose 20.3% mainly supported by digital business services revenue growth of 23.0%.

- Standalone digital services revenues from consumer and corporate segments grew 19.4% driven mainly by an
expanding standalone paid user base.

(4) Following the change in the organizational structure, the revenues from sole proprietorship subscribers that we
define as Merchant, which were previously managed under the Corporate segment, are being reported under the
Consumer segment as of and from the third quarter of 2023. Within this scope, past data has been revised for
comparative purposes.

- Wholesale revenues grew 3.3% to TRY6,475 million (TRY6,269 million).

Turkcell International revenues (excl. Ukraine operations), comprising 2% of Group revenues decreased by 1.8% to
TRY2,626 million (TRY2,673 million).

Techfin segment revenues, comprising 4% of Group revenues, increased by 28.9% to TRY4,569 million (TRY3,545
million). This was driven by a 28.6% rise in Paycell revenues and 27.7% growth in Financell revenues. Please refer
to the Techfin section for details.

Other subsidiaries' revenues, at 7% of Group revenues, including mainly consumer electronics sales revenues, and
non-group energy business revenues decreased by 14.5% to TRY7,969 million (TRY9,317 million).

Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased to 49.6% (52.5%) as a percentage of
revenues for the full year of 2023. This was driven mainly by the decline in interconnection cost (1.9pp), energy cost
(1.5pp), and cost of goods sold (1.5pp), despite the increase in personnel expenses (1.5pp), and other cost items
(0.5pp) as a percentage of revenues for the full year.

Administrative expenses increased to 3.2% (2.8%) as a percentage of revenues for the full year. This was mainly
due to increased personnel expenses.

Selling and marketing expenses increased to 5.3% (4.9%) as a percentage of revenues in FY23. This was driven by
the increase in personnel expenses (0.7pp), despite the decline in marketing expenses (0.1pp) and other expenses
(0.2pp) as a percentage of revenues in FY23.

Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets was at 0.9% (0.7%) as a percentage of revenues in FY23.

                                                                                                    Page 8 of 17

EBITDA1 rose by 19.9% year-on-year in FY23 leading to an EBITDA margin of 41.0% with a 1.8pp improvement
(39.2%).

- Turkcell Türkiye's EBITDA rose 24.1% to TRY40,663 million (TRY32,771 million) leading to an EBITDA margin of
44.2% (42.0%).

- Turkcell International (excl. Ukraine operations) EBITDA increased 9.2% to TRY973 million (TRY891 million)
driving an EBITDA margin of 37.1% (33.3%) on 3.8pp improvement.

- Techfin segment EBITDA declined by 8.1% to TRY1,608 million (TRY1,750 million) with an EBITDA margin of
35.2% (49.3%). The key factor behind the year-on-year decline in EBITDA margin was the rise in funding cost for
Financell compared to the previous year.

- The EBITDA of other subsidiaries declined by 47% to TRY633 million for the full year (TRY1,196 million).

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by 4.0% year-on-year for the full year.

Net finance costs increased to TRY3,451 million (TRY224 million) in FY23. This was driven mainly by higher FX
losses which were partially offset by derivative gains, and the fair value gains registered on currency-protected time
deposits. Additionally, higher interest expenses limited the positive impact.

See Appendix A for details of net foreign exchange gain and loss.

Other expenses increased to TRY4,766 million (TRY1,058 million) for the full year mainly due to donation and
litigation expenses.

See Appendix A for details of net foreign exchange gain and loss.

Income tax expense: The income tax expense of TRY4,676 million (TRY2,785 million) was reported, mainly due to
an increase in deferred income tax expense triggered by the implementation of inflationary accounting in statutory
accounts.

Net income of the Group increased by 82.5% to TRY12.6 billion (TRY6.9 billion) in FY23. This resulted mainly from
strong performance at the revenue and EBITDA levels and the positive impact of deferred income tax expense.

(1) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 16 for the explanation of how we calculate adjusted
EBITDA and its reconciliation to net income.

Total cash & debt: Consolidated cash as of December 31, 2023, increased to TRY49,979 million compared to
TRY42,776 million as of December 31, 2022. This was driven mainly by the positive impact of currency movements.
Excluding FX swap transactions, 53% of our cash is in US$, 20% in EUR, 2% CNY, and 25% in TRY.

Consolidated debt as of December 31, 2023, decreased to TRY84,084 million from TRY88,737 million as of
December 31, 2022 due mainly to the impact of currency movements. Please note that TRY2,428 million of our
consolidated debt is comprised of lease obligations. Please note that 45% of our consolidated debt is in US$, 32%
in EUR, 3% in CNY, 1% in BYN, and 20% in TRY.

Turkcell Group had a long FX position of US$22 million at the end of the year (Please note that this figure takes
hedging portfolio and advance payments into account). The long FX position of US$22 million is in line with our FX
neutral definition, which is between -US$200 million and +US$200 million.

Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures, including non-operational items were at TRY33,950 million in FY23.

For the full year, operational capital expenditures (excluding license fees) at the Group level were at 20.0% of total

(1) Starting from Q421, we have revised the definition of our net debt calculation to include "financial assets"
reported under current and non-current assets. Required reserves held in CBRT balances are also considered in
net debt calculation. We believe that these assets are highly liquid and can be easily converted to cash without
significant change in value.

Turkcell Türkiye subscriber base grew by 799 thousand net additions in FY23 to 42.5 million. In addition, we have
achieved 5.8 million net subscriber additions in the last 3 years thanks to our wide range of solutions tailored to
customer preferences, our pioneering campaigns designed to simplify their lives, our superior infrastructure, a
unique customer experience and our analytical capabilities.

On the mobile front, our subscriber base expanded to 38.0 million on 493 thousand net annual additions in FY23.

total mobile subscribers. We had 476 thousand quarterly postpaid subscriber net additions in Q423. We
experienced a net decline of 708 thousand in our prepaid subscriber base quarter-on-quarter, primarily attributed to
the disconnection of 297 thousand inactive prepaid accounts over the quarter, as per our customer churn policy.

On the fixed front, we saw a net increase of 169 thousand fiber subscribers in FY23, attributable to our investments
in fiber networks, and the robust demand for high-speed, and quality broadband services. Total fixed subscribers
reached 3.1 million on 38 thousand quarterly and 173 thousand annual net additions. Meanwhile, IPTV customers
exceeded 1.4 million on 34 thousand quarterly and 127 thousand annual net additions.

The average yearly mobile churn rate was at 2.0% and the fixed churn rate at 1.5% in FY23, both parallel to the
long-term healthy level of 2%.

On an inflation adjusted basis, our mobile ARPU (excluding M2M) rose 18.4% year-on-year in FY23 driven mainly
by price adjustments to reflect inflationary impacts and upsell to higher tariffs, as well as a larger postpaid
subscriber base. Meanwhile, our residential fiber ARPU remained almost the same year-on-year in FY23.

Average monthly mobile data usage per user rose 15.6% year-on-year to 17.0 GB, with the increasing number and
data consumption of 4.5G users in FY23. Accordingly, the average mobile data usage of 4.5G users reached 18.2
GB in FY23.

Total smartphone penetration on our network reached 90% in Q423. 94% of those smartphones were 4.5G
compatible.

significant portion of Paycell's revenues, continues to be the main vertical for growth, while POS solutions, rapidly
expanding since the last quarter of the previous year, have also supported Paycell's growth.

The quarterly transaction volume (non-group) of the Pay Later service exceeded TRY2 billion, which was utilized by
3-month active Pay Later users of 8.0 million in Q423. Meanwhile, the Paycell Card transaction volume increased

(1) Following the change in the organizational structure, the revenues of Turkcell Sigorta Aracilik Hizmetleri A.S.
(Insurance Agency), which was previously managed under the Financell, has been classified from Financell to
"Other" in the Techfin segment as of the first quarter of 2023. Within this scope, all past data have been revised for
comparability purposes.

Financell's revenues rose by 27.7% for the full year. EBITDA decreased 20.1% yielding an EBITDA margin of
34.2%.
The main factor behind the decline in EBITDA margin compared to the previous year was higher funding cost.

Financell's loan portfolio increased to TRY6.2 billion at the end of the year. Financell has provided loans to about 28
thousand corporate customers. Financell's cost of risk was at 1.6% at the end of the year. In 2023, Financell
expanded its service diversity by offering innovative solutions in technology, green loans for solar, car loans, and
shopping loans for individual and corporate customers. Financell incurred a net loss for the full year mainly due to
the impact of earthquake donation.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS: We believe Adjusted EBITDA, among other
measures, facilitates performance comparisons from period to period and management decision making. It also
facilitates performance comparisons from company to company. Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure
eliminates potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions
(such as the impact of changes in effective tax rates on periods or companies) and the age and book depreciation
of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe
it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the performance of
other mobile operators in the telecommunications industry in Europe, many of which present Adjusted EBITDA
when reporting their results.

Our Adjusted EBITDA definition includes Revenue, Cost of Revenue excluding depreciation and amortization,
Selling and Marketing expenses, Administrative expenses and Net impairment losses on financial and contract
assets, but excludes finance income and expense, other operating income and expense, investment activity income
and expense, share of profit of equity accounted investees and minority interest.

Nevertheless, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation
from, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations, as reported under IFRS. The following table
provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated using financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS
to net profit, which we believe is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in
accordance with IFRS.

RECONCILIATION OF ARPU: ARPU is an operational measurement tool and the methodology for calculating
performance measures such as ARPU varies substantially among operators and is not standardized across the
telecommunications industry, and reported performance measures thus vary from those that may result from the
use of a single methodology. Management believes this measure is helpful in assessing the development of our
services over time. The following table shows the reconciliation of Turkcell Türkiye revenues to such revenues
included in the ARPU calculations of 2022 and 2023.

                                                                                                   Page 14 of 17
