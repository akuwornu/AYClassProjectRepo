Body


UK Finance, which monitors the banking and finance industry, issued the following news release:

Operational Resilience (OpRes) testing aims to ensure that financial institutions can continue their critical
operations throughout severe disruptions.

The opinions expressed here are those of the authors. They do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of UK
Finance or its members.

The goal of OpRes is to maintain service delivery and minimise the potential negative impacts on the organisation
itself, the financial system, its customers, and the broader economy by identifying weaknesses, evaluating their
impact, and implementing necessary improvements. The sector's reliance on technology and third-party services
requires the testing of IT systems, business processes, and third-party dependencies.

Key Components

OpRes testing under DORA encompasses an array of activities designed to assess and strengthen the ability of
financial entities to endure and recover from disruptions. Tests are to be carried out annually and following any
significant changes to the IT environment. Institutions must document test outcomes, implement corrective actions,
and report significant incidents.

Key components of operational resilience testing include:

1. Scenario Analysis and Testing: These realistic scenarios should encompass a wide range of potential threats,
including cyberattacks, data breaches, system failures, loss of staff, and natural disasters. Scenario testing helps
organisations understand the effectiveness of their response strategies and the robustness of their systems and
staff.

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 3

2. Penetration Testing: Penetration tests are crucial for identifying security vulnerabilities. These tests simulate
attacks on the organisation's IT infrastructure to uncover weaknesses that can be exploited. This proactive
approach enables organisations to fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

3. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) Testing: BC/DR testing ensures that organisations have
effective plans in place to continue operations during and after a disruption. This includes testing backup systems,
data recovery procedures, and communication protocols. Regular testing helps ensure that recovery plans are
current and effective, and that roles and responsibilities are understood and reiterated.

4. Third-Party Risk Management: It's essential to assess third-party resilience as well, even if they themselves are
not governed by the DORA. This involves evaluating their operational resilience programs and ensuring they can
meet their obligations during disruptions. Regular audits and contractual agreements with third-party providers are
part of this process. Testing may also highlight a concentrated or distributed third-party risk, encouraging
organisations to re-evaluate their vendor distribution ratios.

Implementing Effective Testing Strategies

Once an organisation has defined its testing strategy, defining what it plans to test, how often, and how far, it can
then consider more advanced testing strategies, including:

* Integrate Testing into Routine Operations: embed resilience testing into regular IT and operational processes to
ensure resilience is continually assessed and improved.

* Leverage Advanced Technologies: utilise technologies such as AI and ML for advanced threat modelling and
simulation to enable more accurate identification of potential vulnerabilities.

* Continuous Improvement: implement a feedback loop where test outcomes and results are used to continuously
refine and improve resilience strategies.

DORA Compliance Reporting

Under Article 19, DORA mandates that institutions report significant incidents to the competent authority, and
provide detailed post-incident reviews.[1]

Institutions must document the outcomes of their testing, including objectives, methodologies, and findings, and
take corrective actions to address identified issues. These records must be readily available for regulatory audits,
as well as for reports following significant ICT-related incidents. Reports ensure that regulators have visibility of the
financial service's operational resilience posture, and can take pre-emptive measures to mitigate systemic risks.

Summary - Benefits of Compliance

DORA compliance enhances an organisation's overall resilience, reduces the risk of operational disruptions, and
builds trust with stakeholders. By adhering to DORA, financial institutions contribute to the stability and integrity of
the broader financial system.

Operational resilience testing is a fundamental aspect of DORA compliance. It enables organisations to proactively
manage and mitigate risks, ensure the continuity of critical services, and safeguard against a wide range of
operational disruptions, thereby securing the system's trust and stability.
