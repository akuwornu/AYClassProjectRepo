management, sharing critical ways to improve business operations with a DMS—in a new article from Messaging
ArchitectsHOBOKEN, N.J., June 13, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- A new article published by Messaging
Architects, an eMazzanti Technologies Company andrecords management expert, reminds businesses that a
document management system (DMS) plays a vital role in ensuring that data becomes a valuable asset instead of a
costly liability.With a DMS, organizations gain a digital system that provides essential visibility into information
throughout the enterprise. It also enables them to smoothly create, manage, store, sign, send, and track electronic
documents.The informative article details four key ways that a DMS delivers essential business benefits. These
include enhanced security and compliance, strengthened collaboration, streamlined document management and
retrieval, and improved disaster recovery."With a DMS, organizations gain a digital system that provides essential
visibility into information throughout the enterprise. It also enables them to smoothly create, manage, store, sign,
send, and track electronic documents," explained Greg Smith, Vice President of Services Delivery at Messaging
Architects.Below are a few excerpts from the article, "4 Ways to Improve Business Operations with a
DMS."Enhance Security and Compliance"The DMS allows granular control over who can access, edit, share, and
delete documents.

Organizations can label sensitive data and enact role-based permissions to ensure access only by authorized
persons. They can also tie retention rules to document labels, automatically archiving or deleting documents
according to regulatory requirements."Boost Collaboration"A core function of a DMS system such asMicrosoft
SharePointinvolves providing a centralized repository for organizing enterprise documents of all kinds. This enables
team members to find needed documents quickly. It also fosters seamless collaboration by allowing multiple users
to work on documents simultaneously."Streamlined Document Management and Retrieval"Teams can utilize
SharePoint's custommetadata tagsto categorize documents. For instance, users can tag documents according to
project, document type, or approval status, making it easier to sort and retrieve files quickly."Safeguard Against
Disaster"The DMS plays a crucial role in protecting documents against loss in the event of disasters such as fire or
cyberattack. For instance, cloud-based DMS solutions provide off-site backups and quick recovery options to
minimize downtime and data loss. And storing documents in the cloud protects them from on-premises
disasters."Choosing the Best DMS for Your BusinessThe right DMS solution for your business depends on several
factors, including business size and document volume, the nature of your workflows, and the level of collaboration
required. Security and compliance requirements also play a role. For assistance implementing the ideal DMS for
your organization, turn to therecords management expertsat Messaging Architects.Have you read?Reasons
