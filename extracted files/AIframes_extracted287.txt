Body


MDT , a CUSO that hosts the Symitar core processing system from Jack Henry(TM) to provide a private cloud
alternative for core processing and IT needs, today announced a partnership with Allure Security , the fastest, most
accurate online brand protection-as-a-service provider.

As fraudsters increasingly target credit unions, leveraging sophisticated tactics like phishing campaigns via SMS,
email, social media, mobile apps, paid ads and even organic search engine results, the need for robust
cybersecurity measures has never been more urgent. That is why MDT has partnered with Allure Security,
providing innovative, proactive fraud protection and online brand protection solutions tailored to the credit union
community. Allure Security leverages sophisticated AI to evaluate tens of millions of digital assets every day to
detect and take down threats, helping credit unions protect themselves and members.

"At Altana FCU, our members are at the core of everything we do - which is why keeping their sensitive information
safe and secure is such a high priority," said Vance Lorenz, VP of IT at Altana Federal Credit Union. "Working with
Allure and MDT has provided even more advanced tools to help us identify and manage threats in a quick, effective
way. Such efforts help ensure that we can keep and maintain our members' trust and confidence, something we will
never take lightly."

"We have gained significant traction in financial services because of our unparalleled detection technology and
mission-driven threat response team, which reduce false positives when it comes to threat identification and quickly
get fake content taken down within minutes or hours instead of days," said Josh Shaul, CEO at Allure Security.
"MDT is deeply committed to providing its credit union clients with the best technology, and we look forward to
helping these institutions strengthen their defenses and keep their members safe."

"There has been an alarming uptick in cybersecurity threats against credit unions, and many institutions are looking
to augment the expertise and resources needed to effectively manage these risks themselves," said Larry Nichols,
CEO and president of MDT. "That is why we're proud to partner with Allure Security, helping safeguard credit
unions and their members through leading technology and services. Allure Security's unique AI-driven approach
