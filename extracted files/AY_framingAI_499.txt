Agreement, UniDoc has agreed upon the initial sale of up to fifteen (15) H3 Health Cube health stations as part of
AVF's objective of providing support to the Ukrainian and Gazan peoples severely affected by conflict, through the
placement of Health Cube health stations to provide territorial eHealth services.Antonio Baldassarre, CEO of
UniDoc, notes: "We are excited to take this first step with the Foundation. This partnership represents an important
milestone in our mission to improve healthcare delivery to all people that need it. By combining our experience and
technology capability with the Foundation's leadership and systems integration, we are confident that together we
will make this trial a success."The Aiutamoli a Vivere ("Let Them Live") Foundation has been operating in countries
through the Franciscan Missions with great social and humanitarian successes recognized by local governments as
well as by Italian, European, and related world assistance organizations. The roots of the Foundation go back to
work done to help the children affected by the Ukraine Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. These initial works
created the conditions for the official establishment of the Foundation in 1992 by two Founding Members: Fr.
Vincenzo Bella (friar of the Conventual Minors) and Dr. Pacifici Fabrizio.Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in
February 2022, the Foundation has supported not only the reception of Ukrainian mothers with their children in Italy
but has promoted an intense activity of sending humanitarian aid, in agreement with the local authorities, carrying
out thirteen missions in Ukraine and obtaining the Accreditation of the Ministry of Justice (n.197/19.4 of 24/07/2023)
to operate on Ukrainian territory.As an integral part of the agreement, AVF will directly manage relationships with its
Ukrainian partners to coordinate the distribution of H3 units at select territorial or institutional entities with the local
references necessary for the managed progress of the project and relations with the Ukrainian Government.
Design, production, transport, and installation will be managed and coordinated by UniDoc.The Foundation is also
supporting aid missions now beginning for the population of Gaza.Terms of the sale are based on the agreed upon
unit price which is anticipated to include per unit transport, assembly, and training on-site. The initial shipment of
three (3) units, based on current estimated fabrication lead time, is expected to be delivered in Q3 2024, and the
cubes are expected to be installed by UniDoc with the relevant training completed within this timeframe.Fabrizio

Pacifici, President and Legal Representative of the Foundation, said: "We believe rural and disadvantaged
populations who use the UniDoc remote Smart Health clinics will benefit from this collaborative effort which will then
lead to accessible, equitable and inclusive healthcare for all, regardless of location or socioeconomic status. By
bringing advanced health services directly to underserved communities, our creative solutions aim to address the
challenges of geographic distance, transportation limitations, and lack of health infrastructure in remote areas. We
expect this will have a positive impact on communities in need, improving patient health outcomes and improving
their overall well-being." On Behalf of the Board of Directors,~Antonio Baldassarre~Antonio Baldassarre
