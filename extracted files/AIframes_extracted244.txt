ISV revenue increased 19% year over year on a pro forma basis(g), to $59 million and represented 18% of total
revenue in the fourth quarter.SMB revenue increased 2% year over year on a pro forma(g) basis, to $82 million and
represented 26% of total revenue in the fourth quarter.In summary, total revenue increased 11% year over year on
a pro forma(g) basis in the fourth quarter.Revenue by regionOn a regional basis, revenue increased across all
geographies. In North America ("NA"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America ("LATAM"), and
Asia Pacific ("APAC"), revenue increased by 99%, 9%, 19% and 28% respectively for the fourth quarter. In NA,
EMEA, LATAM, APAC, revenue increased 91%, 5%, 55% and 5%, respectively for the year ended December 31,
2023.Cash DividendNuvei today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a cash
dividend of $0.10 per subordinate voting share and multiple voting share, payable on April 4, 2024 to shareholders
of record as of March 19, 2024. The aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be approximately $14 million,
to be funded from the Company's existing cash on hand.The Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter ended
December 31, 2023, and any future dividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to report such
dividend as a dividend to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for
taxation as "qualified dividend income" and therefore may be taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains.
A U.S. shareholder should talk to its advisor regarding such dividend, including with respect to the "extraordinary
dividend" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US).The declaration, timing, amount and payment of future
dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, as more fully described under the heading "Forward-
Looking Information" of this press release.Financial Outlook(d)For the three months ending March 31, 2024 and
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, Nuvei anticipates Total volume(a), Revenue, Revenue at constant
currency(b) and Adjusted EBITDA(b) to be in the ranges below. The financial outlook includes the acquisition of Till
Payments from the date of acquisition (January 5, 2024).Total volumes quarter-to-date have been encouraging.
Nevertheless, the Company has taken a prudent approach to building its financial outlook for the current year,
weighing optimism for its business and prospects against macro uncertainties, and applying more rigor around
expected timing for new customer implementations throughout the yearNuvei generally expects for its underlying
quarterly revenue growth rates and Adjusted EBITDA margins to ramp up throughout the year, with an objective to
exit the year in line with the Company's medium-term revenue growth target of 15 – 20%. While there are near-term
Adjusted EBITDA margin implications as the Company integrates Till Payments, Nuvei is focused on achieving
breakeven or better on the acquisition before year-end.Normalizing for the acquisition, the Company's underlying
Adjusted EBITDA margin expectation is between 36 – 37% for the three months ending March 31, 2024, which is
consistent with the exit rate for the three months ending December 31, 2023.The financial outlook, including the
various underlying assumptions, constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities
laws and is fully qualified and based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks described under
the headings "Forward-Looking Information" and "Financial Outlook and Growth Targets Assumptions" of this press
release. Growth TargetsNuvei's medium-term(e) annual growth target for revenue, as well as its medium-term(e)
target for capital expenditures (acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a percentage of
revenue and long-term(e) target for Adjusted EBITDA margin(c), are shown in the table below. In addition, the
Company believes it has a defined path to accelerate the growth in its B2B, government and ISV channel(c) to
20%-plus over the medium term(e). Furthermore, the Company believes its scaled global platform has reached an
inflection point whereby it can continue to expand Adjusted EBITDA margin(c). Nuvei's targets are intended to
provide insight into the execution of its strategy as it relates to growth, profitability and cash generation. These
medium(e) and long-term(e) targets should not be considered as projections, forecasts or expected results but
rather goals that we seek to achieve from the execution of our strategy over time, and at a further stage of business
maturity, through geographic expansion, product innovation, growing wallet share with existing customers and new
customer wins, as more fully described under the heading "Summary of Factors Affecting our Performance" of our

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 9

most recent Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These
growth targets, including the various underlying assumptions, constitute forward-looking information within the
meaning of applicable securities laws and are fully qualified and based on a number of assumptions and subject to
a number of risks described under the headings "Forward-Looking Information" and "Financial Outlook and Growth
Targets Assumptions" of this press release. We will review and revise these growth targets as economic, market
and regulatory environments change. This is the performance of the Company with respect to these metrics over
the last three years: In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Organic revenue growth excluding digital
assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency(b) was 17% and pro forma B2B, government and ISV channel
revenue growth(g) was 16%. Conference Call InformationNuvei will host a conference call to discuss its fourth

MeasuresNuvei's Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by
the IASB. The information presented in this press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS
financial ratios and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Paya Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA margin, Revenue at constant currency, Revenue growth at constant currency, Organic Revenue at
constant currency, Organic revenue growth at constant currency, Organic revenue excluding digital assets and
cryptocurrencies at constant currency, Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by
IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these
measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding
of our results of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation
nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial statements reported under IFRS. These measures are
used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in Nuvei's
business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS and other financial
measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to facilitate operating performance
comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine
components of management compensation. We believe these measures are important additional measures of our
performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used widely among others in the payment
technology industry as a means of evaluating a company's underlying operating performance.The information in
this press release also includes a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, namely Paya Adjusted EBITDA, for periods
prior to Nuvei's acquisition of Paya on February 22, 2023. This measure is not a recognized measure under U.S.
GAAP and does not have standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to
similar measures presented by other companies, including Nuvei's. Rather, this measure is provided as additional
information to complement U.S. GAAP measures by providing further understanding of Paya's results of operations.
Prior to its acquisition by Nuvei, Paya's financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting

                                                                                                         Page 4 of 9

principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), and Paya Adjusted EBITDA has been derived
from Paya's annual or interim financial statements for the period prior to the acquisition. IFRS differs in certain
material respects from U.S. GAAP. Paya adjusted EBITDA presented in this press release has not been adjusted to
give effect to the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS or to accounting policies that comply with IFRS and as
applied by Nuvei, nor has such financial information been conformed from accounting principles under U.S. GAAP
to IFRS as issued by the IASB, and thus may not be directly comparable to Nuvei's presentation of Adjusted
EBITDA. However, we have assessed the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS and have determined the
impact to be immaterial on the combined financial metrics presented in this press release, such that no adjustments
would be necessary. Paya Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP
and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income before income taxes, or any other operating
performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresRevenue at
constant currency: Revenue at constant currency means revenue, as reported in accordance with IFRS, adjusted
for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This measure helps provide insight on comparable
revenue growth by removing the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year. Foreign
currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates
applied to the current period foreign currency amounts.Organic revenue at constant currency: Organic revenue
at constant currency means revenue, as reported in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude the revenue
attributable to acquired businesses for a period of 12 months following their acquisition and excluding revenue
attributable to divested businesses, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Foreign
currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates
applied to the current period foreign currency amounts. This measure helps provide insight on organic and
acquisition-related growth and presents useful information about comparable revenue growth.Organic revenue
excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency:Organic revenue excluding digital assets
and cryptocurrencies at constant currency means revenue excluding the revenue attributable to acquired
businesses for a period of 12 months following their acquisition and excluding revenue attributable to divested
businesses and digital assets and cryptocurrencies, and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange
fluctuations. This measure helps provide insight on comparable revenue growth by removing the effect of volatility
in digital assets and cryptocurrencies and changes in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year. Foreign
currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior period quarterly average exchange rates
applied to the current period foreign currency amounts. The revenue attributable to digital assets and
cryptocurrencies is calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the revenue line item
presented in the Company's financial statements under IFRS.Adjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a
means to evaluate operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and
amortization, income tax expense, acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related
payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and legal settlement and other.Paya Adjusted EBITDA:
Paya Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest and other expense, income taxes, depreciation, and
amortization, or EBITDA and further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and other non-
recurring items that Paya believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. Prior to its acquisition by Nuvei, Paya
was disclosing Paya Adjusted EBITDA because this non-U.S. GAAP measure was a key measure used by it to
evaluate its business, measure its operating performance and make strategic decisions. Nuvei is disclosing Paya
Adjusted EBITDA in order to show Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA and Combined leverage
ratio.Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA: Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA
represents the summation for the trailing twelve months of Nuvei's Adjusted EBITDA with Paya's Adjusted EBITDA
for the period prior to the acquisition. Prior to its acquisition by Nuvei, Paya's financial statements were prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, and Paya Adjusted EBITDA has been derived from Paya's annual or interim financial
statements for periods prior to the acquisition. IFRS differs in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. Paya
Adjusted EBITDA presented in this press release has not been adjusted to give effect to the differences between
U.S. GAAP and IFRS or to accounting policies that comply with IFRS and as applied by Nuvei, nor has such
financial information been conformed from accounting principles under U.S. GAAP to IFRS as issued by the IASB,
and thus may not be directly comparable to Nuvei's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of financial
information on a combined basis does not comply with IFRS. The combined financial information included in this
press release is unaudited and does not purport to be indicative of the Company's results of operations and

                                                                                                        Page 5 of 9
                             Nuvei Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Results

financial condition had Nuvei and Paya operated as a combined entity during the periods presented, and should not
be considered as a prediction of the financial information that will result from the operations of the Company on a
consolidated basis following the acquisition. We use Combined trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA because
we believe it provides insight into the operations of the combined company for the periods presented. Adjusted
EBITDA less capital expenditures: We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (which we define as
acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary indicator of our operating
performance.Adjusted net income: We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and
profitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before
acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign
currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax expense or
recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in redemption value of liability-classified
common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase liability and accelerated amortization of
deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other.Non-IFRS Financial RatiosRevenue growth at constant
currency: Revenue growth at constant currency means the year-over-year change in Revenue at constant
currency divided by reported revenue in the prior period. We use Revenue growth at constant currency to provide
better comparability of revenue trends year-over-year, without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates.Organic revenue growth at constant currency: Organic revenue growth at constant currency
means the year-over-year change in Organic revenue at constant currency divided by comparable Organic revenue
in the prior period. We use Organic revenue growth at constant currency to provide better comparability of revenue
trends year-over-year, without the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency
exchanges rates.Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant
currency:Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency means the
year-over-year change in Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency
divided by comparable Organic revenue excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies in the prior period. We use
Organic revenue growth excluding digital assets and cryptocurrencies at constant currency to provide better
comparability of revenue trends year-over-year, without the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, volatility in digital
assets and cryptocurrencies and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Adjusted EBITDA
margin:Adjusted EBITDA margin means Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.Adjusted EBITDA less capital
expenditures conversion: Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures conversion means Adjusted EBITDA less
capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures conversion to
measure our capacity to convert Adjusted EBITDA into Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures.Combined
leverage ratio: Combined leverage ratio means net debt divided by Combined trailing twelve months adjusted
EBITDA. Net debt represents the carrying amount of Nuvei's Total credit facilities excluding unamortized
transaction costs less Cash and cash equivalents. We use Combined leverage ratio as an additional measure to
monitor our financial leverage.Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share: We use Adjusted net
income per basic share and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a
per share basis. Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less net
income attributable to non-controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. The number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted
average number of common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is
determined using the treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS.Supplementary Financial MeasuresWe
monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance,
identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our key performance
indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key performance indicators used by other
companies.Total volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume
and similar measures are used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a
company's performance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in the period by
customers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue earned by us. Total
volume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle,
gateway/technology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology services but are not in the flow of funds in
the settlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar value of transactions processed relating to APMs and
payouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales volume and transaction-based, generated from merchants' daily sales
and through various fees for value-added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will

                                                                                                           Page 6 of 9
                              Nuvei Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Results

generally impact our revenue. Organic total volume at constant currency: Organic total volume at constant
currency is used as an indicator of performance of our business on a more comparable basis. This measure helps
provide insight on organic and acquisition-related growth and presents useful information about comparable Total
volume growth. This measure also helps provide better comparability of business trends year-over-year, without the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic total volume at constant currency means Total
volume excluding Total volume attributable to acquired businesses for a period of 12 months following their
acquisition and excluding Total volume attributable to divested businesses, adjusted for the impact of foreign
currency exchange fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange impact in the current period is calculated using prior
period quarterly average exchange rates applied to the current period foreign currency amounts.Nuvei pro forma
revenue: Nuvei pro forma revenue represents Nuvei's reported revenue after giving effect to the acquisition of
Paya as though such acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. Nuvei pro forma revenue is
presented both on an aggregated basis and by channel. In order to align with the Company's presentation of
revenue calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the revenue line item presented in
the Company's financial statement under IFRS, Paya's revenue contribution amounts are presented net of
interchange fees, which was not the case for a small portion of fees prior to the acquisition of Paya by the
Company. This presentation is consistent with the pro forma disclosure required under IFRS in Nuvei's
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. This measure helps provide insight on
the combined revenue of the Nuvei and Paya businesses.Nuvei pro forma revenue growth:Nuvei pro forma
revenue growth represents Nuvei reported revenue divided by Nuvei pro forma revenue in the comparative year.
This ratio is presented both on an aggregated basis and by channel. This ratio helps provide a better understanding
of the additional contribution of the Paya business on Nuvei's year-over-year revenue growth. Nuvei pro forma
revenue is used as a component of this ratio only until the completion of a full financial year following the acquisition
of Paya.Forward-Looking InformationThis press release contains "forward-looking information" and "forward-
