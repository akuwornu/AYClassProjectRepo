Episode 564

Fetch.ai's (CRYPTO: FET) ($FET) CEO, Humayun Sheikh, interview is on New to The Street's "Game Changers"
segment with TV Host Ana Berry. Humayun gives a corporate progress update on its AI ecosystem and the tools
available for developers. Over 25000+ have signed up for access to the platform. Fetch.ai makes AI tools available
to many who can develop and deploy AI-based apps anytime, anywhere, and on an operational scale. As an easy-

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 5

to-use Fetch AI ecosystem, developers can create and deploy AI-based apps promptly and at an affordable price.
Humayun believes that large Big Tech entities should not control AI but be mainstream. He, however, believes that
governmental regulation should be in place to make sure AI is good for humankind. With geopolitical tension and a
forthcoming US election, AI-generated content needs validation for authenticity and truthfulness. As an open
platform for the new AI economy, Fetch.ai is the first AI Agent platform that allows developers to create 100,000
apps. Fetch AI agents can connect, search, and transact from dynamic interactions, promoting social well-being
and economic growth. While building, deploying, and monetizing an open AI ecosystem, Fetch.ai technology
platforms are "Game Changers" for the AI technology industry. The on-screen QR code is available during the
show; download or visit Fetch AI - www.fetch.ai.

New to The Street airs its second "Game Changers" segment with TV Host and Multi-media Journalist Ana Berry,
who talks with Dr. Navjit Dhaliwal ("Nav"), CEO of Iagon (CRYPTO: IAG) ($IAG). As "Game Changers" in the
decentralized cloud storage business, Iagon gives end-users complete data control. Clients control the use of their
data and are no longer given access to extensive "Big Tech" platforms without consent or fees. Nav likens Iagon to
Airbnb for data storage, where the client can determine where they would like data stored, options through
numerous data nodes worldwide. Decentralized and centralized data are two completely different ways of data
management. Nav gives an analogy: data lakes, whereas centralized data has limited cybersecurity features, and
data breaches often occur, such as data theft. Decentralized data lakes are like frozen lakes, with solid encryption
features placed on a blockchain, which only gives end-users access to data. Iagon's decentralized data ecosystem
provides unbridled security features not found on open BIG TECH platforms. Nav talks about the Company's recent
achievements and ongoing developments. Currently, Iagon has about 300 storage nodes globally. Iagon is growing,
maturing, and showing the importance of digital decentralized storage solutions. As "Game Changers" in the data
storage industry, Iagon's blockchain ecosystem offers unique product offerings while ensuring complete data
protection, integrity, and efficiency. The on-screen QR code is available during the show; download or visit Iagon -

New to The Street airs another "Game Changers" segment, The Sustainable Green Team, Ltd.'s (OTCQX: SGTM)
($SGTM) Tony Raynor, CEO and Founder, talks with TV Host and Multi-media Journalist Ana Berry. SGTM is
revolutionizing sustainability using cutting-edge technology, converting waste into viable products. Wood, organic,
and animal waste are raw materials that SGTM recycles into usable and valuable nutrients for the agricultural
markets. Demand for recycled organic products is rising globally as the world's population sees the increasing
importance and impact of recycling and sustainability needs. Tony talks about the 250 million acres in the USA
allocated for raising cattle, pigs, and chickens. SGTM has numerous contracts to remove animal waste from farms
and ranches to create recycled organic products. The Company also works with landfills nationwide, removing
wood and other organic waste materials for recycling. Using SGTM's technology and manufacturing capabilities, its
HumiSoil product, a mix of humus and a catalyst, restores soil's organic nutrients and creates water hydration.
SGTM's sustainable products are "Game Changers," dramatically improving the planet. Tony welcomes viewers to
join SGTM's movement; opt-in https://www.thesustainablegreenteam.com/ and go to its YouTube channel, which
has many informative videos about the Company and its sustainable initiatives. The on-screen QR code is available

From the New York Stock Exchange Studio, Kortney Murray, CEO/Founder of Coastal Kapital, LLC, talks about the
Company with New to The Street's TV Host Jane King. Jane and Kortney inform views about a new series coming
to New to The Street: "All Things Capital." The show will focus on alternative and traditional capital sources, such
as banks, wealth management, venture capital, private equity funders, family offices, and other sources. As a co-
host, Kortney will interview people who have successfully navigated complex and rigid approval processes to get
capital for business operations and expansions. Interviews will include those who have used Coastal Kapital and
discuss how those clients met their business capital needs and improved their business operations. Women
business owners seem to have more problems raising capital. Kortney will dive into these issues, interview
successful women, and discuss their businesses and what worked and didn't work in finding reliable capital
sources. Coastal Kapital is different from traditional funding sources, and it's a non-bank and non-credit report
funding source that takes a hands-on "Human" approach to capital needs. Traditional banks use a 1950s

                                                                                                 Page 3 of 5

creditworthy method to make loan determinations. In today's high-tech world, this bank method doesn't work,
especially for influencers, e-commerce, FinTech firms, and others that banks view as unfavorably, denying loan
applications. Coastal Kapital - "Financing You Can Trust" offers solutions when other traditional funding sources
deny capital to business owners. Kortney prides herself and her team on looking at individuals and their business
models and will decide on capital loans. Coastal Kapital uses a different set of algorithmic calculations from those
used by traditional banks. Coastal Kapital's system puts in other data sets that can develop a more comprehensive
understanding of a business. Then, the team puts their "Human" approach to every client's capital needs with the
objective of funding the client's business. Coastal Kapital is successfully rolling out its affiliate program, which can
offer its capital formation services nationwide. The new show, "All Things Capital," will focus on capital funding and
other topics like tax strategies, entrepreneurism, mentorship, and leadership roles. Viewers can expect
announcements on airing dates/times on the new show, "All Things Capital." The on-screen QR code is available

New to The Street TV airs its "Sekur Privacy & Sekur Security – The Weekly Hack" segment with internationally
acclaimed internet privacy expert Mr. Alain Ghiai, CEO of Sekur Private Data Ltd. (OTCQX: SWISF) (CSE: SKUR)
(FRA: GDT0) ($SWISF) and TV Host and Multi-media Journalist Ana Berry. Ana is talking about her friend's hacked
Instagram account. This person has not gained access or control of the account for over a year. Ana's friend told
her that she used her email account to register as a customer for a clothing store from an Instagram post. Alain
explains that Big Tech constantly data mines account holders' information and then sells that information to 3rd
party entities. Social media sites do the same with data mining. These mining activities greatly reduce cybersecurity
availabilities for end-user accounts on these platforms. Hackers gain access and have AI abilities just like the Big
Tech platforms to scan and seek individuals' and businesses' private data. Once obtained, they create
cybersecurity issues like Ana's friend's problem. A solution is to use Sekur's SekurMail with the
SekurSend/SekurReply feature. Sekur's subscription-based-encrypted platforms operate on multiple servers owned
and located in Switzerland, a country with very tough privacy laws. Alain recommends the Company's SekurVPN
services, which provide encrypted Swiss IP addresses to anyone worldwide. Sekur's services can offer an
affordable, secure, and private ecommunication platform for individuals, businesses, and enterprises. Subscribers
get one week free on any of the Company's services, and Sekur is offering PROMO CODE: "PRIVACY," which
gives 15% savings toward monthly and yearly subscriptions, which is good for five years. Tune in next time for
another cybersecurity topic on the "Sekur Privacy & Sekur Security– Weekly Hack" segment. The on-screen QR

About Iagon (CRYPTO: IAG) ($IAG):

Iagon was founded in 2017 in Hamar, Norway, because people need to be in control of their data. The idea started
as an attempt to solve significant issues related to how healthcare data is stored, with modern solutions severely
lacking transparency for individuals at a national and international level. The protocol will allow storage providers to
earn rewards by trading their excess storage to resource consumers on a marketplace at a transparent price while
ensuring data privacy, security, and accessibility. Its token-based economy is based on computer, server, and data
center owners who join the storage and processing power grids. In return for sharing the capabilities of their
machine, they will be granted Iagon tokens that can be traded back to fat money, while any party who wishes to
utilize their capabilities will purchase tokens to distribute them to the parties that provide their services to the
blockchain grid - https://iagon.com/.
