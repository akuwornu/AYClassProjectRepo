WISeKey International Holding Ltd. (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a global leader in cybersecurity,
digital identity, and Internet of Things (IoT) innovations, today unveiled a significant expansion of its WISeSat.Space
strategy for 2024. WISeSat.Space is a subsidiary of WISeKey, revolutionizing IoT connectivity with the first cost-
effective and secure solution, leveraging picosatellites and low-power sensors to provide unparalleled IoT
connectivity across the globe.

The strategic expansion includes the scheduled launch of new satellites in the fourth quarter of 2024, alongside the
introduction of groundbreaking technology aboard its latest generation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. This
initiative is designed to meet the extensive IoT deployment needs across various sectors, including Smart Farming,
Energy, and Logistics, ensuring reliable and secure data transmission anywhere on Earth.To date, seventeen
satellites equipped with WISeSat technology have been launched into orbit aboard SpaceX rockets, marking the
initial phase of a visionary plan to deploy an 80-satellite constellation. This network aspires to provide
comprehensive global IoT connectivity with an impressive data latency goal of just 10 hours.

In anticipation of the emerging quantum computing era, WISeSat.Space is proactively enhancing its security
measures. The company is pioneering the adoption of post-quantum cryptographic solutions and devices provided
by SEALSQ, WISeKey’s semiconductor subsidiary, thereby establishing new benchmarks for secure multi-factor
authentication and the protection of critical data exchanges in the quantum future.Geostationary (“GEO”) satellites
have long provided Internet access to remote regions, with a few satellites covering the globe due to their large size
and stationary position relative to Earth. Despite their global reach and simple ground antenna setup, GEO

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4

satellites suffer from high latency, over 600 milliseconds, making them unsuitable for modern applications like real-
time video, gaming, and virtual reality due to the long distance (36,000 km) signals must travel to and from Earth.

In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) satellites offer low-latency, high-speed Internet connections as they orbit much
closer to Earth (160 to 2000 km). However, their fast movement means they can't stay over one spot, requiring a
large constellation of satellites and tracking antennas for continuous coverage. After earlier failures in the 1990s,
advancements in technology and commercial launch systems have now made it feasible and more cost-effective to
deploy LEO satellite constellations, with many companies and governments pursuing this approach for global
Internet access.

The use of WISeSat.Space operations employing Low Earth Orbit (“WISESAT.SPACE LEO”) satellites presents a
transformative potential across a wide range of sectors beyond the initial applications in smart farming, energy,
logistics, and the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”). By leveraging the lower latency and the potential for higher-
speed Internet connections provided by WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites, as compared to geostationary (GEO)
satellites, numerous sectors stand to benefit significantly.

Sectors to benefit from WISESAT.SPACE LEO expansion include:

1. Environmental Monitoring and Climate ChangeWISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites can be instrumental in
monitoring climate change by providing data on atmospheric conditions, sea level rise, ice sheet melting rates, and
deforestation. This real-time data is crucial for predicting weather patterns, tracking natural disasters, and
implementing early warning systems for floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, thereby aiding in disaster preparedness
and response.

2. Maritime and Aeronautical Applications For maritime and aeronautical sectors, WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites
offer improved navigation, communication, and tracking of vessels and aircraft over vast and remote areas like
oceans and polar regions. Enhanced AIS (“Automatic Identification System”) tracking, coupled with real-time
weather and oceanographic data, can significantly improve maritime safety and efficiency. Similarly, in aviation,
better communication and tracking can enhance route planning, safety, and search and rescue operations.

3. Defense and National Security The defense sector can leverage WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites for secure
communication, reconnaissance, surveillance, and remote sensing over global hotspots. Real-time satellite imagery
and data can support tactical operations, border security, and monitoring of strategic assets.

4. Healthcare and Telemedicine WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites can bridge the digital divide by providing high-
speed internet access to remote and underserved regions, facilitating telemedicine services. This can revolutionize
healthcare delivery, enabling remote diagnostics, patient monitoring, and access to specialist consultations, thereby
improving health outcomes in rural and isolated communities.

5. Education Access to reliable and fast internet is a cornerstone for modern education. WISESAT.SPACE LEO
satellites can provide connectivity to remote and rural schools, supporting digital learning platforms, virtual
classrooms, and access to a vast array of online educational resources, thus democratizing education.

6. Banking and Financial Services The financial sector, including banking, trading, and other services, can benefit
from the low-latency network provided by WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites. This is crucial for high-frequency
trading where milliseconds matter, rural banking, mobile payment systems, and financial inclusion initiatives in
remote areas.

7. Media and Entertainment For media and entertainment, WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites enable live
broadcasting, streaming of high-definition content, and new forms of interactive entertainment even in remote
locations. This can significantly enhance the viewer experience for global events, remote sports broadcasting, and
provide universal access to entertainment and information.

8. Scientific Research and Space Exploration WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites support scientific research in
areas like astrophysics, earth sciences, and environmental monitoring. They also play a crucial role in space

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 4

exploration, acting as relay stations for deep space missions, enhancing communication, and data transfer between
Earth and spacecraft or space stations.

9. Tourism and Adventure With the advent of space tourism, WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites could provide
communication and safety support for commercial space flights, space hotels, and other off-world adventures.
Additionally, they can enhance experiences for adventure tourism on Earth by offering navigation, safety tracking,
and communication in remote regions.

10. Urban and Smart Cities In the context of urban development, WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites can support
smart city initiatives by providing real-time data for traffic management, public safety, environmental monitoring, and
infrastructure management, ensuring efficient and sustainable urban living.

By harnessing the capabilities of WISESAT.SPACE LEO satellites through WISeSat.Space operations, these
sectors can achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency, accessibility, and global reach, paving the way for
innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges.
