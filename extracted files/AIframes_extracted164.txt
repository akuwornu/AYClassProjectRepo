programVANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - TELUS Corporation (TSX: T) (NYSE: TU) today released
its unaudited results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Consolidated operating revenues and other income increased by
2.8 per cent over the same period a year ago to $5.2 billion. This growth was driven by higher service revenues in
our two reportable segments: TELUS technology solutions (TTech) and Digitally-led customer experiences –
TELUS International (DLCX). TTech service revenue growth was driven by: (i) higher mobile network revenues
attributable to subscriber and moderating roaming revenue growth; (ii) an increase in fixed data service revenues,
resulting from subscriber growth and higher, albeit moderating, revenue per internet customer; and (iii) growth in
health services revenues. These factors were partly offset by lower TV and fixed legacy voice services revenues,

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 17
     TELUS reports operational and financial results for fourth quarter 2023; announces 2024 financial targets

primarily due to technological substitution, as well as macroeconomic and competitive pressures impacting
consumer purchasing decisions across various products.

Higher DLCX operating revenues resulted from expanded services for certain existing clients and growth from new
clients, including new clients from our acquisition of WillowTree on January 3, 2023, and favourable foreign
exchange impacts, which collectively more than offset the impact of some DLCX clients managing their own costs
thus reducing our revenue. SeeFourth Quarter 2023 Operating Highlightswithin this news release for a discussion
on TTech and DLCX results. "Throughout 2023, our team successfully navigated a highly competitive industry,
overcame a challenging macroeconomic landscape and a dynamic regulatory environment, to achieve strong
financial and operational results across our business. Indeed, our results for the year demonstrate execution
strength in our TTech business segment, characterized by the potent combination of leading customer growth,
complemented by strong operational and financial results, and enhanced by our significant and ongoing focus on
cost efficiency. These results were buttressed by improving and resilient fourth quarter profitability from our DLCX
segment, despite the continued challenging macroeconomic operating environment faced by TELUS International,"
said Darren Entwistle, President and CEO. "Robust performance in our core telecom business is underpinned by
our globally leading broadband networks and superior customers-first culture. This enabled our strongest fourth
quarter customer growth on record, with total net additions of 404,000, up 34 per cent, year-over-year, driven by
strong demand for our leading portfolio of bundled services across Mobility and Fixed services. The fourth quarter
capped off a record setting year for customer net additions of 1,266,000, surpassing our previous record high in
2022 by more than 21 per cent, and marked the second consecutive year our team delivered more than one million
new customer additions. These strong results included robust Fixed subscriber growth of 259,000; our highest
Mobile Phone net additions since 2010 with 443,000 net new customers; and all-time record connected device net
additions of 564,000. TELUS' industry-leading growth reflects the consistent potency of our operational execution,
and our unmatched bundled product offerings across Mobile and Home. Our team's passion for delivering customer
service excellence contributed to continued strong loyalty across our key product lines, once again this quarter.
Notably, postpaid mobile phone churn of 0.87 per cent for the full year marks the tenth consecutive year at less
than one per cent.""Today, TI reported its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results that featured solid revenue
growth, notwithstanding a continued challenging operating environment. Importantly, TI delivered on its commitment
to improve profitability in the second half of the year, exiting the year with a strong margin profile more aligned with
its historical trends," continued Darren. "Our synergistic relationship offered meaningful support for TI's business,
alongside momentum fuelled by the AI solutions that TI provides to companies like Google, its second largest client,
offsetting an otherwise softer demand environment. The improvement in TI's profitability also reflected meaningful
cost efficiency efforts implemented during the year, realigning its cost base to better meet the near-term demand
environment. Over the long-term, TI remains an exciting growth story, with meaningful opportunities driven by digital
transformation, underpinned by robust AI capabilities.""At our TELUS Health business unit, we achieved fourth
quarter revenues of $432 million, alongside 24 per cent EBITDA contribution growth, delivering total annual
revenues of $1.7 billion along with 11 per cent EBITDA contribution growth. We continue to execute on our global
growth strategy and demonstrate our progress towards our goal to be the most trusted wellbeing company in the
world. This includes our healthcare services and programs now covering nearly 70 million lives around the world, an
increase of 1.8 million year-over-year; supporting health outcomes on 610 million digital health transactions during
2023, up five per cent over last year; and increasing our virtual care membership to 5.6 million, up more than 24 per
cent over the prior year. Since acquiring LifeWorks in 2022, our team has committed to driving $427 million in
annualized synergies by the end of 2025. This includes $327 million expected to be realized through operating cost
synergies from continued integration, and optimizing our organizational structure, systems and real estate.
Furthermore, we anticipate $100 million from longer-term revenue synergies driven by cross-selling health services
products within our TELUS Health customer base, and throughout our TELUS portfolio of assets, including TELUS
International. To date, we have achieved $233 million in combined annualized synergies, towards our overall
objective. These synergies will allow us to re-invest in the growth of our business and improve our profitability, while
we focus on delivering efficient, secure and best-in-class health and wellness solutions to our customers.""Our all-
time record customer growth is underpinned by our dedicated team who are passionate about delivering superior
service offerings and digital capabilities, over our world-leading wireless and PureFibre broadband networks,"
added Darren. "Importantly, TELUS' networks continued to earn global accolades in 2023 for reliability,
expansiveness, speed and superiority, including multi-year recognition from independent, third-party organizations,

                                                                                                    Page 3 of 17

such as Opensignal and PCMag. TELUS has been recognized as Canada's most awarded network by Opensignal
over six consecutive years, while PCMag named TELUS Canada's best mobile carrier, and Best mobile carrier for
business, in their annual Readers' Choice Awards. With respect to fixed, PCMag recognized TELUS as the Fastest
Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Canada for the fourth consecutive year in 2023. These accolades illustrate the
TELUS team's steadfast commitment to connecting Canadians to the people and information that matter
most."Darren further commented, "The generational broadband network investments that TELUS has made over
the last decade will continue to drive extensive socio-economic benefits for Canadians in communities from coast-
to-coast, while underpinning the continued advancement of our financial and operational performance. These
investments power our team's ability to consistently drive profitable growth over the long-term, on the back of our
differentiated asset base, best-in-class customer experience, and world-leading networks, alongside our unique
growth businesses. This provides us with confidence in the robust outlook for our business and delivering on the
annual targets for 2024 that we have announced today. These include TTech Operating Revenues and Adjusted
EBITDA increases of 2 to 4 per cent and 5.5 to 7.5 per cent, respectively; Consolidated Capital Expenditures of
approximately $2.6 billion; alongside Consolidated Free Cash Flow of approximately $2.3 billion, up circa 30 per
cent over 2023, bolstered by strong EBITDA growth and stable capital investments. Our outlook for 2024 will be
supported by the 2024 targets announced this morning by TI, with revenue and EBITDA growth of 3 to 5 per cent
and 7 to 10 per cent, respectively, and industry leading free cash flow yield in line with TI's historical average.
Combining our outlook for TTech and TI, Consolidated Operating Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA are expected to
grow at similar rates approximate to our TTech outlook. Furthermore, the unparalleled skill, innovation, grit and
execution excellence of our team, on our consistent and winning strategy, underpins our leading multi-year dividend
growth program, now in its fourteenth year, through to the end of 2025.""To further buttress the sustainability of our
consistently strong performance, against the backdrop of the rapid transformation in our industry due to the evolving
regulatory, competitive and macroeconomic environment that we currently face, we continue to focus on executing
the extensive efficiency and effectiveness initiative across TELUS, initially announced in August. Importantly, the
transformational investments we have prudently made over the course of more than a decade in building the best
culture, and enabling industry-leading customer experiences over our globally leading wireless and PureFibre
broadband networks, allowed us to accelerate our well-progressed plans to digitally revolutionize our business and
further streamline our operating costs. Our team's grit, resilience and ability to embrace change and continuously
evolve the way we operate have enabled us to achieve our targeted team member reductions in 2023, with the full
run-rate of annualized cost savings expected to be realized in the second quarter of 2024. Furthermore, our focus
on cost efficiency is continuing into 2024, targeting incremental restructuring investments of approximately $300
million. While these come with many difficult decisions, we continue to leverage our decades-long track record of
successfully navigating exogenous factors, in order to rise to the current challenges and future proof our
business.""Against the backdrop of these ongoing challenges, our TELUS family continues to bring our caring
culture to life," said Darren. "Last year alone, our team members and retirees logged an unprecedented 1.5 million
hours of volunteerism in communities across the globe — an unparalleled accomplishment that is more than any
other company in the world. Importantly, this represents the fifth consecutive year that we have collectively
contributed over one million hours. This brings us to a total of $1.6 billion gifted in cash, in-kind contributions, time
and support programs, and 16 million hours, which equates to 2.2 million days of volunteering since 2000. Due, in
part, to our team's unsurpassed dedication to putting our communities and customers first, the TELUS brand has
increased in value from $10.3 billion in 2023 to circa $11.5 billion today as ranked in the Brand Finance 2024 global
report. Notably, TELUS moved up two places to become the most valuable telco brand in Canada and the eighth
most valuable brand, nationally."Doug French, Executive Vice-president and CFO said, "In the fourth quarter of
2023, our team achieved strong operational and financial results, supported by our consistent focus on profitable
customer growth and our ongoing focus on cost efficiency. For the year, operating revenue growth of 9.4 per cent
was effectively aligned with the lower end of our updated guidance, while Adjusted EBITDA landed within the
targeted range. Cash flow from operations decreased by 6.5 per cent and free cash flow increased by 38 per cent
to approximately $1.8 billion, surpassing our updated target of approximately $1.5 billion. The higher free cash flow
result for the year reflects the timing of restructuring payments of approximately $200 million related to our
efficiency program in 2023 that will flow into 2024 along with a lower-than-expected cash impact from device
financing."Doug added, "In the fourth quarter, we purposefully accelerated capital expenditures, focusing additional
investments in digitization and platform development, particularly within key growth areas of our business, along
with additional investments to expand the reach of our PureFibre network within targeted communities. These

                                                                                                    Page 4 of 17
     TELUS reports operational and financial results for fourth quarter 2023; announces 2024 financial targets

additional investments will further enhance our go-to-market opportunities as we begin the new year. Our team also
continued to execute against our significant cost efficiency program focused on driving sustainable EBITDA
expansion, margin enhancements and cash flow generation. As we head into 2024, cost efficiency will remain a key
priority as we identify further opportunities across our organization.""Our continued strong operational and financial
performance supports our robust balance sheet and liquidity position" added Doug. "Our debt maturity schedule is a
testament to our prudent financial planning. With the average maturity of our long-term debt of over 11 years, and
87 per cent of our debt being fixed, we are well-positioned to successfully navigate a dynamic operating
environment with resilience and foresight. Furthermore, the average cost of our long-term debt of 4.33 per cent at
the end of 2023 remains low relative to current rates. Our balance sheet in 2024 will be further enhanced by the
meaningful increase in free cash flow alongside strong EBITDA growth, and supported by our stable core capital
expenditure outlook of approximately $2.6 billion, excluding investments related to real estate development
initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, our consolidated capital intensity in 2024 will remain low and in the 13 per
cent range. This strong position further supports our industry-leading dividend growth program now in place through
2025, along with deleveraging our balance sheet while continuing to make strategic investments to continue
advancing our winning and sustainable growth strategy.""For 2024, we have established ambitious financial targets,
building off our leading growth profile and operating execution excellence. Our financial outlook reflects continued
healthy growth within our core TTech business as we maintain our consistent focus on profitable customer growth
driven by continued demand for our superior bundled offerings over our leading broadband networks. Furthermore,
in 2024, we anticipate improving financial contributions from TELUS International, as well as from TELUS Health
and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods," Doug concluded.As compared to the same period a year ago, net
income in the quarter of $310 million was up 17 per cent and Basic earnings per share (EPS) of $0.20 increased by
18 per cent. These increases were driven by the impacts from: (i) consolidated EBITDA growth, as discussed
below; and (ii) the estimated unrealized appreciation recorded from our virtual power purchase agreements with
renewable energy projects as of December 31, 2023. These were partially offset by: (i) higher depreciation and
amortization reflecting increases related to growth in capital assets in support of the expansion of our broadband
footprint, including our generational investment to connect homes and businesses to TELUS PureFibre and 5G
technology coverage; and growth in internet, TV and security subscriber loading; (ii) higher interest costs primarily
from greater long-term debt outstanding, attributable in part to business acquisitions, in addition to an increase in
the effective interest rate; and (iii) higher employee benefits expense to reflect higher restructuring costs related to
accelerated cost efficiency programs. As it relates to EPS, the trends also reflect the effect of a higher number of
Common shares outstanding. When excluding the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related
adjustments, real estate rationalization-related restructuring impairments, virtual power purchase agreements
unrealized change in forward element, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, and other
adjustments (see 'Reconciliation of adjusted Net income' in this news release), adjusted net income of $341 million
increased by 0.6 per cent over the same period last year, while adjusted basic EPS of $0.24 was unchanged over
the same period last year. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure and adjusted basic EPS is a non-
GAAP ratio. For further explanation of these measures, see 'Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures' in
this news release.Compared to the same period last year, consolidated EBITDA increased by 6.7 per cent to
approximately $1.7 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9.4 per cent to more than $1.8 billion. The growth in
Adjusted EBITDA reflects: (i) broad-based cost reduction efforts across both the TTech and DLCX segments,
including workforce reductions, synergies achieved between LifeWorks and our legacy Health business, and
increased TTech outsourcing to DLCX, as well as savings in marketing, discretionary, and administrative costs; (ii)
higher mobile network, residential internet and security revenues largely driven by subscriber growth; (iii) higher
mobile equipment margins; and (iv) organic health services growth. These factors were partly offset by: (i) merit-
based compensation increases; (ii) higher bad debt expense; (iii) declining TV and fixed legacy voice margins; (iv)
higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities, inclusive of increased subscription-based software
licences, contractor and cloud usage costs; and (v) lower agriculture and consumer goods margins.In the fourth
quarter, we added 404,000 net customer additions, up 103,000 over the same period last year, and inclusive of
126,000 mobile phones and 203,000 connected devices, in addition to 36,000 internet, 23,000 TV and 23,000
security customer connections. This was partly offset by residential voice losses of 7,000. Our total TTech
subscriber base of more than 19.3 million is up 7.6 per cent over the last twelve months, reflecting a 4.1 per cent
increase in our mobile phones subscriber base to 10.1 million, and a 26 per cent increase in our connected devices
subscriber base to more than 3.1 million. Additionally, our internet connections grew by 8.8 per cent over the last

                                                                                                    Page 5 of 17
     TELUS reports operational and financial results for fourth quarter 2023; announces 2024 financial targets

twelve months, surpassing 2.6 million customer connections, our TV subscriber base increased by 5.2 per cent to
approximately 1.4 million customers, and our security customer base expanded by 8.0 per cent to over 1 million
customers.In health services, as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, virtual care members were 5.6 million and
healthcare lives covered were 69.5 million, up 24 per cent and 2.7 per cent over the past twelve months,
respectively. Digital health transactions in the fourth quarter of 2023 were 157.9 million, up 3.7 per cent over the
fourth quarter of 2022.Cash provided by operating activities increased by $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2023
and free cash flow of $590 million increased by $267 million compared to the same period a year ago reflecting
lower capital expenditures and lower income taxes paid, partly offset by an increase in cash interest paid. The
increase in free cash flow was driven by: (i) higher EBITDA; (ii) lower restructuring and other costs, net of
disbursements, due to a greater number of real estate rationalization initiatives where payments of executory costs
will be disbursed over multiple years, in addition to the timing of disbursements for personnel-related costs
expected to impact the following year; (iii) lower income taxes paid, net of refunds; and (iv) a decline in capital
expenditures.Consolidated capital expenditures of $533 million, including $47 million for real estate
development,decreased by 19 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. TTech operations drove $141 million of the
decrease primarily due to the planned slowdown of our fibre and wireless network build and systems development,
which is consistent with 2023 build targets when compared to the accelerated investments in 2022. TTech real
estate development capital expenditures of $47 million increased by $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to
increased capital investment to support construction of multi-year development projects including TELUS Ocean
and other commercial buildings in B.C. By December 31, 2023, our 5G network covered more than 31.6 million
Canadians, representing approximately 86 per cent of the population.Consolidated Financial HighlightsFourth
Quarter 2023 Operating HighlightsTELUS technology solutions (TTech)TTech operating revenues (arising
from contracts with customers) increased by $113 million or 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily
reflecting increases in mobile network revenue, mobile equipment and other service revenues, fixed data services
revenues, and health services revenues, as described below. Decreases in fixed voice services revenues, fixed
equipment and other service revenues and agriculture and consumer goods services revenues were partial
offsets.TTech EBITDA increased by $43 million or 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, while TTech Adjusted
EBITDA increased by $119 million or 8.0 per cent, reflecting: (i) broad-based cost reduction efforts across both the
TTech and DLCX segments, including workforce reductions, synergies achieved between LifeWorks and our legacy
Health business, and increased TTech outsourcing to DLCX, as well as savings in marketing, discretionary, and
administrative costs; (ii) higher mobile network, residential internet and security revenues largely driven by
subscriber growth; (iii) higher mobile equipment margins; and (iv) organic health services growth. These factors
were partly offset by: (i) merit-based compensation increases; (ii) higher bad debt expense; (iii) declining TV and
fixed legacy voice margins; (iv) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities, inclusive of increased
subscription-based software licences, contractor and cloud usage costs; and (v) lower agriculture and consumer
goods margins.Mobile products and servicesMobile network revenue increased by $64 million or 3.8 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 2023, largely due to growth in our mobile phone and connected device subscriber base, as well as
moderating roaming revenue growth. These impacts were partly offset by the impact of lower base rate plan prices
and lower overage revenues, discussed below in mobile phone ARPU.Mobile equipment and other service
revenues increased by $9 million or 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to higher-value
smartphones in the sales mix. This was partly offset by a reduction in contracted volumes attributed to increased
promotional activity centred around rate plans and market aggression, in addition to more customers taking
advantage of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) plan offerings.TTech mobile products and services direct contribution
increased by $74 million or 4.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, largely reflecting mobile subscriber growth,
higher equipment margins and higher roaming margins associated with increased international travel volumes.
These were partly offset by the impact of lower base rate plan prices and lower overage revenues as discussed
below in mobile phone ARPU.Mobile phone ARPU was $58.50 in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting a year over
year decrease of $0.19 or 0.3 per cent for the fourth quarter. This decrease is attributed to lower overage revenues
as customers continue to adopt larger or unlimited data and voice allotments in their rate plans, in addition to lower
base rate plan prices from increased promotional activity and market aggression affecting both new and existing
customers, which first escalated in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the heightened seasonal
promotional periods. These impacts are partly mitigated by our continued focus to drive higher-value loading and
realize higher, albeit moderating, roaming revenues from increased travel.Mobile phone gross additions were
545,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 83,000 or 18 per cent, driven by continued market-driven

                                                                                                    Page 6 of 17

promotional activity, which first escalated in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the remainder of the
year during the heightened seasonal promotional periods; in addition to increased retail and digital traffic, our 5G
subscription value proposition on Public Mobile and growth in the Canadian population.Mobile phone net additions
were 126,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 14,000 or 13 per cent, driven by higher mobile phone
gross additions, partially offset by higher mobile phone churn, as described below.Our mobile phone churn rate was
1.40 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 1.22 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022, largely due to
higher customer switching activity from heightened seasonal promotional activity, as discussed above. These
factors have been partly mitigated by our continued focus on customer retention through our industry-leading
service and network quality, successful promotions and bundled offerings.Connected device net additions were
203,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 97,000, attributable to increased IoT connections from
customers in the transportation, healthcare and home security industries.Fixed products and servicesFixed data
services revenues increased by $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in our internet,
security and TV subscribers and higher, albeit moderating, revenue per customer as a result of internet speed
upgrades and rate changes. This growth was partially offset by lower TV revenue per customer, reflecting an
increased mix of customers selecting smaller TV combination packages and technological substitution.Fixed voice
services revenues decreased by $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting the ongoing decline in legacy
voice revenues as a result of technological substitution and price plan changes. Declines were partly mitigated by
the success of our bundled product offerings, our retention efforts and the migration from legacy to IP services
offerings.Fixed equipment and other service revenues decreased by $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2023,
largely reflecting a reduction in residential and business development project work, both as a result of the non-
recurrence of large projects in the fourth quarter of 2022 and rising interest rates that softened the property
development market in 2023.TTech fixed products and services direct contribution increased by $11 million or 0.8
per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting increased internet and security margins, driven by subscriber
growth and higher, albeit moderating, revenue per customer as a result of internet speed upgrades and rate
changes, in addition to organic health services growth. These were fully offset by technological substitution driving
declines in TV and legacy voice margins, as well as lower agriculture and consumer goods margins as a result of
transient headwinds and macroeconomic challenges.Internet net additions were 36,000 in the fourth quarter of
2023, a decrease of 6,000, due to a higher churn rate from macroeconomic and competitive pressures impacting
consumer purchasing decisions, partly offset by our success in driving strong gross additions in the consumer
market through diverse products and services.TV net additions were 23,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, an
increase of 6,000, due to our diverse products and services, partly offset by higher churn related to the same
factors as internet.Security net additions were 23,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 5,000, due to
higher churn related to the same factors as internet, partly offset by increased demand for our bundled product
offerings and diverse products and services.Residential voice net losses were 7,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023,
an increased loss of 3,000. Our bundled product and lower-priced offerings have been successful at mitigating
losses and minimizing substitution to mobile and internet-based services.Health servicesThrough TELUS Health,
we are leveraging technology to deliver connected solutions and services, improving access to care and
revolutionizing the flow of information while facilitating collaboration, efficiency, and productivity across the
healthcare ecosystem, progressing our vision of transforming healthcare and empowering people to live healthier
lives.Health services revenues increased by $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by: (i) demand for our
integrated health, productivity, retirement and benefit solutions; (ii) increased pharmacy management software
revenue; and (iii) the continued adoption of our virtual care solutions.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 5.6
million members were enrolled in our virtual care services, an increase of 1.1 million over the past 12 months,
attributable to the continued adoption of virtual solutions that keep Canadians and others safely connected to health
and wellness care.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, our healthcare programs covered 69.5 million lives, an
increase of 1.8 million over the past 12 months, mainly due to healthy growth in our employee and family assistance
programs from both new and existing clients across all of our regions, in addition to continued demand for virtual
solutions.Digital health transactions were 157.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.6 million,
largely driven by increased paid exchange of healthcare data between our health benefits management system and
care providers resulting from higher patient demand for elective health services.Agriculture and consumer goods
servicesThrough TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, we provide innovative digital solutions and actionable
data-insights that better connect the global supply chain, driving more efficient production processes and improving
the safety, quality and sustainability of food and consumer goods. Importantly, these efforts are also enabling better

                                                                                                    Page 7 of 17

traceability to the end consumer, further supporting improved food outcomes.Agriculture and consumer goods
services revenues decreased by $2 million or 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 reflecting transient
headwinds and macroeconomic challenges, including subscription demand softness and customer churn for our
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based revenue management software for consumer goods manufacturers. These
effects were partly offset by increased animal agriculture pharmacy and research revenues. Our agriculture and
consumer goods revenues are largely earned in U.S. dollars, and in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the
fourth quarter of 2022, the Canadian dollar was consistent against the U.S. dollar.Digitally-led customer
experiences – TELUS International (DLCX)DLCX operating revenues (arising from contracts with customers)
increased by $20 million or 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to
growth in our tech and games, eCommerce and fintech and other industry vertical clients, arising from additional
services provided to certain existing clients and new clients added since the prior year, including new clients from
the acquisition of WillowTree. This growth was partially offset by lower revenues from one of our largest clients, a
leading social media company, as well as a global financial institution client. In addition, the strengthening of both
the U.S. dollar and the European euro against the Canadian dollar resulted in a favourable foreign currency impact
on our DLCX operating results.Revenue from our tech and games industry vertical increased by $7 million in the
fourth quarter of 2023, due to continued growth experienced with a number of our technology clients and the
addition of new clients, which was partially offset by lower revenue from one of our largest clients, a leading social
media company.Revenue from our communications and media industry vertical increased by $43 million in the
fourth quarter of 2023, driven primarily by more services provided to the TTech segment and the addition of new
clients from our acquisition of WillowTree.Revenue from our eCommerce and fintech industry vertical increased by
$10 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, due to the addition of new clients from our acquisition of WillowTree,
partially offset by a decline in service volumes from fintech clients.Revenue from our healthcare industry vertical
increased by $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to more services provided to the healthcare
business unit of the TTech segment.Revenue from our banking, financial services and insurance industry vertical
decreased by $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, due to lower service volumes from a global financial institution
client, partially offset by the addition of new clients from our acquisition of WillowTree.DLCX EBITDA increased by
$64 million or 37 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, while DLCX Adjusted EBITDA increased by $39 million or
19 per cent in the same period. The increases in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily due to other income
arising from the revaluation on our provisions for written put options, positive impacts realized from cost efficiency
efforts initiated in the second quarter of 2023, and lower share-based compensation, which were partially offset by
cost imbalances arising from reductions in service demand, principally in Europe, from some of our larger
technology clients, with the impacts being more significant beginning in the second quarter of 2023.Corporate

gross loading and customer renewal volumes, competitive intensity and changing customer preferences. Continued
connected devices growth, as our IoT offerings diversify and expand.Continued growth in fixed products and
services data revenue, reflecting an increase in internet, TV and security subscribers, speed upgrades, rate plans
with larger data buckets or unlimited data usage, and expansion of our broadband infrastructure, healthcare

operating costs associated with growth related to scaling our digital health offerings, with a focus on deploying
value-added services effectively and optimizing efficiency.Impacts on our international operations from the global

services business through business acquisitions and organic growth.Continuation of our digitization efforts to
simplify the many ways our customers do business with us, introduce new products and services, respond to
customer and market needs, and provide highly reliable service.The extent to which the economic growth estimates
affect us and the timing of their impact will depend upon the actual experience of specific sectors of the Canadian
economy.Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or other events to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements made herein and in other TELUS filings include, but are not limited to, the
following:Regulatory matters. We operate in a number of highly regulated industries and are therefore subject to a

(including on revenue and free cash flow).Risks and uncertainties include:changes to our regulatory regime or the
outcomes of proceedings, cases or inquiries relating to its application, including but not limited to those set out in
Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings in our 2023 annual MD&A;the
potential for government to allow consolidation of competitors in our industry or conversely for government to
intervene with the intent of further increasing competition, for example, through mandated wholesale access,
including to fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) facilities;the potential for additional government intervention on pricing,

significant enforcement powers;potential threats to unitary federal regulatory authority over communications in
Canada;potential threats to the CRTC's ability to enforce competitive safeguards such as the Standstill Rule and
the Wholesale Code, which aim to ensure the fair treatment by vertically integrated firms of rival competitors
operating as both broadcasting distributors and programming services;regulatory action by the Competition Bureau
or other regulatory agencies;spectrum allocation and compliance with licences, including our compliance with
licence conditions, changes to spectrum licence fees, spectrum policy determinations such as restrictions on the

and ancillary service fees;restrictions on non-Canadian ownership and control of the common shares of TELUS
Corporation (Common Shares) and the ongoing monitoring of, and compliance with, such restrictions;unanticipated
changes to the current copyright regime, which could impact obligations for internet service providers or
broadcasting undertakings;our ability to comply with complex and changing regulation of the healthcare, virtual care
and medical devices industries in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including as an operator of health clinics;
and risks related to the quality of care and provision of insured/uninsured services; andour ability to comply with, or
facilitate our clients' compliance with, numerous, complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both
domestically and internationally.Competitive environment. Competitor expansion, activity and intensity (pricing,
including discounting, bundling), as well as non-traditional competition, disruptive technology and disintermediation,
may alter the nature of the market and impact our market share and financial results (including revenue and free
cash flow).Risks and uncertainties include:our ability to continue to retain customers by providing a customer
service experience that meets or exceeds expectations, a range of relevant products and services and a reliable
state-of-the-art network;the intensity of competition, including aggressive promotional offers and device financing
strategies and the ability of industry competitors to offer bundled and/or discounted services;competition across all
services with communications companies and virtual broadcast distribution undertakings and other over-the-top
(OTT) services, which, among other things, places pressures on current and future average revenue per subscriber
per month (ARPU), cost of acquisition, cost of retention and churn rates for all services;consolidation, mergers and
acquisitions of industry competitors (including the acquisition of Shaw by Rogers and associated assets divested to
Videotron), as well as any related regulatory actions;regional operators leveraging wholesale access regulations to
enter the market;low-earth-orbit satellite internet services becoming available in urban areas;our ability to obtain
and offer content on a timely basis across multiple devices on mobile and TV platforms at a reasonable cost as
content costs per unit continue to grow;vertical integration in the broadcasting industry resulting in competitors
owning broadcast content services, and timely and effective enforcement of related regulatory safeguards;TI's
ability to compete with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology
companies with digital capabilities, and traditional contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that
are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services;in our TELUS Health
business, our ability to compete with other providers of employee and family assistance programs, benefits
administration, electronic medical records and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems
integrators and health service providers, including competitors with a vertically integrated mix of health services
delivery, IT solutions and related services, global providers that could achieve expanded Canadian footprints, and
providers of virtual healthcare services, preventative health services and personal emergency response services;
andin our TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods business, our ability to compete with focused software and IoT
competitors.Technology. Consumer adoption of alternative technologies and changing customer expectations have
the potential to impact our revenue streams and customer churn rates.Risks and uncertainties include:reduced
utilization and increased commoditization of traditional fixed voice services (local and long distance) resulting from

                                                                                                  Page 13 of 17
     TELUS reports operational and financial results for fourth quarter 2023; announces 2024 financial targets

impacts of OTT applications and mobile substitution;a declining overall market for TV services, resulting in part from
content piracy and signal theft, a rise in OTT direct-to-consumer video offerings and virtual multichannel video
programming distribution platforms;the increasing number of households with only mobile and/or internet-based
telephone services;potential decline in ARPU as a result of, among other factors, substitution by messaging and
OTT applications; substitution by increasingly available Wi-Fi services;disruptive technologies, such as OTT IP
services, including software-defined networks in the business market that may displace or cause us to reprice our
existing data services, and self-installed technology solutions;any failure to innovate, maintain technological
advantages or respond effectively and in a timely manner to changes in technology;high subscriber demand for
data that challenges wireless networks and spectrum capacity levels and may be accompanied by increases in
delivery cost;the roll-out, anticipated benefits and efficiencies, and ongoing evolution of wireless broadband
technologies and systems;availability of resources and our ability to build out adequate broadband capacity;our
reliance on wireless network access agreements, which have facilitated our deployment of mobile technologies;our
choice of suppliers and those suppliers' ability to maintain and service their product lines, which could affect the
success of upgrades to, and evolution of, technology that we offer;supplier limitations and concentration and market
power for products such as network equipment, TELUS TV and mobile handsets;our expected long-term need to
acquire additional spectrum capacity through future spectrum auctions and from third parties to address increasing
demand for data, and our ability to utilize spectrum we acquire;deployment and operation of new fixed broadband
network technologies at a reasonable cost and the availability and success of new products and services to be
rolled out using such network technologies;network reliability and change management; andour deployment of self-
learning tools and automation, which may change the way we interact with customers.Security and data protection.
Our ability to detect and identify potential threats and vulnerabilities depends on the effectiveness of our security
controls in protecting our infrastructure and operating environment, and our timeliness in responding to attacks and
recovering business operations. A successful attack may impede the operations of our network or lead to the
unauthorized interception, destruction, use or dissemination of customer, team member or business
information.Generative AI (GenAI).GenAI exposes us to numerous risks including risks related to the responsible
use of AI, data privacy and cybersecurity, and the possibility that our use of AI may produce inaccurate or
inappropriate content or create negative perceptions among companies and regulators that could affect demand for
our services.Climate and the Environment. Natural disasters, pandemics, disruptive events and climate change may
impact our operations, customer satisfaction and team member experience.Risks and uncertainties include:loss of
employee work time as a result of illness or injury;public concerns related to radio frequency emissionsclimate-
related risks (such as extreme weather events and other natural hazards);waste and waste recycling;risks relating
to fuel systems on our properties and the environmental impact of our network including legacy network equipment;
andchanging government and public expectations regarding environmental matters and our responses.Our goals to
achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations are subject to our
ability to identify, procure and implement solutions to reduce energy consumption and adopt cleaner sources of
energy, our ability to identify and make suitable investments in renewable energy, including in the form of virtual
power purchase agreements, and our ability to continue to realize significant absolute reductions in energy use and
the resulting GHG emissions in our operations.Operational performance and business combination. Investments
and acquisitions present opportunities to expand our operational scope, but may expose us to new risks. We may
be unsuccessful in gaining market traction/share and realizing benefits, and integration efforts may divert resources
from other priorities.Risks and uncertainties include:our ability to identify suitable candidates for partnerships or
strategic transactions and our ability to complete these transactions;our reliance on legacy systems and our ability
to implement and support new products and services and business operations in a timely manner;our ability to
manage the requirements of large enterprise deals;our ability to implement effective change management for
system replacements and upgrades, process redesigns, cost efficiency programs and business integrations (such
as our ability in a timely manner to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions into our operations and culture,
complete divestitures or establish partnerships and realize expected strategic benefits, including those following
compliance with any regulatory orders);our ability to identify and manage new risks inherent in new service offerings
that we may provide, including as a result of acquisitions, which could result in damage to our brand, our business
in the relevant area or as a whole, and additional exposure to litigation or regulatory proceedings;our ability to
effectively manage the growth of our infrastructure and integrate new team members;our reliance on third-party
cloud-based computing services to deliver our IT services; andeconomic, political and other risks associated with
doing business globally (including war and other geopolitical developments), as we have assets and operations

                                                                                                  Page 14 of 17

located outside Canada and the U.S.Customer service. Our service delivery directly impacts customer experience,
customer churn rates, and likelihood to recommend outcomes. We may not be able to deliver the excellence our
customers expect or maintain our competitive advantage in this area.Risks and uncertainties include:our ability to
successfully implement cost reduction initiatives (including efficiency and effectiveness programs, business
integrations, business product simplification, business process automation and outsourcing, offshoring,
reorganizations, procurement initiatives, and real estate rationalization).Our systems and processes. Systems and
technology innovation, maintenance and management may impact our IT systems and network reliability, as well as
our operating costs.Risks and uncertainties include:our ability to maintain customer service and operate our
network in the event of human error or human-caused threats, such as cyberattacks and equipment failures that
could cause various degrees of network outages;technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns;delays and
rising costs, including as a result of government restrictions or trade actions; andthe completeness and
effectiveness of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and responses.Our team. The rapidly evolving and
highly competitive nature of our markets and operating environment, along with the globalization and evolving
demographic profile of our workforce, and the effectiveness of our internal training, development, succession and
health and well-being programs, may impact our ability to attract, develop and retain team members with the skills
required to meet the changing needs of our customers and our business. There may be greater physical and mental
health challenges faced by team members (and their families) as a result of the pandemic, and the effect of other
significant change initiatives at the organization may result in the loss of key team members through short-term and
long-term disability.Risks and uncertainties include:recruitment, retention and appropriate training in a highly
competitive industry (including retention of team members leading recently acquired businesses in emerging areas
of our business);the level of our employee engagement and impact on engagement or other aspects of our
business or any unresolved collective agreements;our ability to maintain our unique culture and team member
engagement as we grow and implement organizational changes and cost reduction initiatives;the risk that certain
independent contractors in our business could be classified as employees; andthe physical and mental health of our
team, which are critical to engagement and productivity.Suppliers. We may be impacted by supply chain disruptions
and lack of resiliency in relation to global or local events. Dependence on a single supplier for products,
components, service delivery or support may impact our ability to efficiently meet constantly changing and rising
customer expectations while maintaining quality of service.Real estate matters. Real estate investments are
exposed to possible financing risks and uncertainty related to future demand, occupancy and rental rates,
especially following the pandemic. Future real estate developments may not be completed on budget or on time
and may not obtain lease commitments as planned.Financing, debt and dividends. Our ability to access funding at
optimal pricing may be impacted by general market conditions and changing assessments in the fixed-income and
capital markets regarding our ability to generate sufficient future cash flow to service our debt. Our current intention
to return capital to shareholders could constrain our ability to invest in our operations to support future growth.Our
capital expenditure levels and potential outlays for spectrum licences in auctions or purchases from third parties
affect and are affected by: our broadband initiatives, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to
fibre; our ongoing deployment of newer mobile technologies, including wireless small cells that can improve
coverage and capacity; investments in network technology required to comply with laws and regulations relating to
the security of cyber systems, including bans on the products and services of certain vendors; investments in
network resiliency and reliability; the allocation of resources to acquisitions and future spectrum auctions held by
Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), including the millimetre wave spectrum auction,
which is expected to commence in 2024. Our capital expenditure levels could be impacted if we do not achieve our
targeted operational and financial results or if there are changes to our regulatory environment.Lower than planned
free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders.
This program may be affected by factors such as the competitive environment, fluctuations in the Canadian
economy or the global economy, our earnings and free cash flow (which may be affected by restructuring and other
costs resulting from initiatives such as post-acquisition integration and cost efficiency programs), our levels of
capital expenditures and spectrum licence purchases, acquisitions, the management of our capital structure,
regulatory decisions and developments, and business continuity events. Quarterly dividend decisions are subject to
assessment and determination by our Board of Directors based on our financial position and outlook. There can be
no assurance that our dividend growth program will be maintained through 2025 or renewed.Factors that may affect
TI's financial performance are described in TI's public filings available on SEDAR+ and EDGAR. TI may choose to
publicize targets or provide other guidance regarding its business and it may not achieve such targets. Failure to

                                                                                                  Page 15 of 17
     TELUS reports operational and financial results for fourth quarter 2023; announces 2024 financial targets

meet these targets could affect TELUS' ability to achieve targets for the organization as a whole and could result in
a decline in the trading price of the TI Subordinate Voting Shares or the TELUS Common Shares or both.Tax
matters. Complexity of domestic and foreign tax laws, regulations and reporting requirements applying to TELUS
and our international operating subsidiaries may impact financial results, effective governance of tax considerations
and compliance. International acquisitions and expansion of operations heighten our exposure to multiple forms of
taxation.Risks and uncertainties include:interpretation of complex domestic and foreign tax laws by the relevant tax
authorities that may differ from our interpretations;the timing and character of income and deductions, such as
depreciation and operating expenses;tax credits or other attributes;changes in tax laws, including tax rates;tax
expenses that are materially different than anticipated, including the taxability of income and deductibility of tax
attributes or retroactive application of new legislation;elimination of income tax deferrals; andchanges to the
interpretation of tax laws, including those resulting from changes to applicable accounting standards or the adoption
of more aggressive auditing practices by tax authorities, tax reassessments or adverse court decisions impacting
the tax payable by us.The economy. Changing global economic conditions, including a potential recession and
alternating expectations about inflation, as well as our effectiveness in monitoring and revising growth assumptions
and contingency plans, may impact the achievement of our corporate objectives, our financial results (including free
cash flow), and our defined benefit pension plans.Risks and uncertainties include:the state of the economy in
Canada, which may be influenced by economic and other developments outside of Canada, including potential
outcomes of future policies and actions of foreign governments;expectations regarding future interest
rates;inflation;unemployment levels;immigration levels;effects of volatility in oil prices;effects of low business
spending (such as reducing investments and cost structure);pension investment returns and factors affecting
pension benefit obligations, funding and solvency discount rates;fluctuations in exchange rates of the currencies of
various countries in which we operate;sovereign credit ratings and effects on the cost of borrowing;the impact of
tariffs on trade between Canada and the United States; andglobal implications of the dynamics of trade
relationships among major world economies.Litigation and legal matters. Complexity of, and compliance with, laws,
regulations, commitments and expectations may have a financial and reputational impact.Risks and uncertainties
include:our ability to successfully respond to investigations and regulatory proceedings;our ability to defend against
existing and potential claims and lawsuits (including intellectual property infringement claims and class actions
based on consumer claims, data, privacy or security breaches and secondary market liability), or our ability to
negotiate and exercise indemnity rights or other protections in respect of such claims and lawsuits; andthe
complexity of legal compliance in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with competition, anti-
bribery and foreign corrupt practices laws.These risks are described in additional detail inSection 9 General trends,
outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedingsandSection 10 Risks and risk
managementin our 2023 annual MD&A. Those descriptions are incorporated by reference in this cautionary
statement but are not intended to be a complete list of the risks that could affect the Company.Many of these risks
and uncertainties are beyond our control or outside of our current expectations or knowledge. Additional risks and
uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, financial performance, cash flows, business or reputation. Except as
otherwise indicated in this document, the forward-looking statements made herein do not reflect the potential impact
of any non-recurring or special items or any mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other business combinations or
transactions that may be announced or that may occur after the date of this document.Readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this document describe our
expectations, and are based on our assumptions, as at the date of this document and are subject to change after
this date. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements in this news release are presented for the purpose of assisting our
investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected 2024 financial results as well as our
objectives, strategic priorities and business outlook. Such information may not be appropriate for other
purposes.This cautionary statement qualifies all of the forward-looking statements in this document.Non-GAAP and
other specified financial measuresWe have issued guidance on and report certain non-GAAP measures that are
used to evaluate the performance of TELUS, as well as to determine compliance with debt covenants and to
manage our capital structure. As non-GAAP measures generally do not have a standardized meaning, they may not
be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For certain financial metrics, there are definitional
differences between TELUS and TELUS International reporting. These differences largely arise from TELUS
International adopting definitions consistent with practice in its industry. Securities regulations require such

                                                                                                  Page 16 of 17
     TELUS reports operational and financial results for fourth quarter 2023; announces 2024 financial targets

measures to be clearly defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure. Certain of the metrics
do not have generally accepted industry definitions.Adjusted Net income and adjusted basic earnings per share
(EPS):These are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS-IASB and
are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted Net income
excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses
related to real estate joint ventures, long-term debt prepayment premium, unrealized changes in virtual power
purchase agreements forward element, and other adjustments (identified in the following tables). Adjusted basic
EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted-average number of Common Shares
outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level and exclude items that, in
management's view, may obscure underlying trends in business performance or items of an unusual nature that do
not reflect our ongoing operations. They should not be considered alternatives to Net income and basic EPS in
measuring TELUS' performance.Reconciliation of adjusted Net incomeReconciliation of adjusted basic
EPSEBITDA(earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization): We have issued guidance on
and report EBITDA because it is a key measure used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level. EBITDA is
commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company's operating
performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. EBITDA should not be considered as
an alternative to Net income in measuring TELUS' performance, nor should it be used as a measure of cash flow.
EBITDA as calculated by TELUS is equivalent to Operating revenues and other income less the total of Goods and
services purchased expense and Employee benefits expense.We also calculateAdjusted EBITDAto exclude items
of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations and should not, in our opinion, be considered in a
long-term valuation metric or should not be included in an assessment of our ability to service or incur
debt.Adjusted EBITDA less capital expendituresis calculated for our reportable segments, as it represents a
simple cash flow view that may be more comparable to other issuers.Free cash flow: We report this measure as a
supplementary indicator of our operating performance, and there is no generally accepted industry definition of free
cash flow. It should not be considered as an alternative to the measures in the Consolidated statements of cash
flows. Free cash flow excludes certain working capital changes (such as trade receivables and trade payables),
proceeds from divested assets and other sources and uses of cash, as found in the Consolidated statements of
cash flows. It provides an indication of how much cash generated by operations is available after capital
expenditures that may be used to, among other things, pay dividends, repay debt, purchase shares or make other
investments. We exclude impacts of accounting standards that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.
Free cash flow may be supplemented from time to time by proceeds from divested assets or financing
activities. Mobile phone average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU) is calculated as network revenue
derived from monthly service plan, roaming and usage charges; divided by the average number of mobile phone
subscribers on the network during the period, and is expressed as a rate per month.AppendixOperating revenues
