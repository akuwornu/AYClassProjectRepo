PR NewswireRESTON, Va. , March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- OVHcloud® US, a leading global cloud provider, is
excited to announce its parent company's continued international expansion with the opening of a second Canadian
site (the Group's 42nd data center), supported by a long-term investment of CAD 145 million. Located in
Cambridge, Ontario, the OVHcloud data center is in the heart of one of North America's most dynamic innovation
clusters, the perfect location for providing trusted cloud solutions meeting the heightened demands of Canadian and
international businesses in terms of performance, resilience, and data governance. The new Toronto data center,
like other global OVHcloud data centers, will be accessible to OVHcloud US customers and will deliver improved
latency compared to the existing OVHcloud data center near Montreal and the OVHcloud US data center in Vint
Hill, Virginia. This data center opening continues to showcase OVHcloud's momentum in the U.S. and North
American markets.

 A global player and European leader in cloud computing, OVHcloud has been established in Canada since 2011,
where it employs 250 people and operates 90,000 servers hosted in one of the industry's most eco-responsible
data centers, located on Montreal's South Shore. OVHcloud is opening its first site in Ontario, supported by a CAD
145 million investment over the next 8 years, to support the growth and needs of its customers within a framework
of extended trust. Dedicated to the development of its new data center and to the industrial innovations that are the
hallmark of the trusted cloud leader, this investment includes, in its first phase, the hiring of a number of qualified
talents.Located inthe Ascent TOR1 hyperscale development, this new data center has a surface area of 1,000
m2, a capacity of 10,000 servers and 2MW of power. More than just a data center, it embodies the technological
know-how that has earned OVHcloud its reputation for operational excellence and energy efficiency. Its vertically
integrated model (OVHcloud builds its own servers, up to 600 a week in its Beauharnois plant) and the industrial
scale-up of its water-cooling technology are major assets in providing an optimal performance-price ratio and a
controlled environmental footprint, in line with the expectations of businesses that want to exercise full control over
their digital assets."This new data center marks a major turning point in the history of OVHcloud in Canada,
enabling our customers and businesses in the Toronto area to strengthen their infrastructure while retaining full
control of their cloud journey, free from any form of technological or pricing lock-in. We're also looking forward to
making a difference by continuing to innovate for a sustainable digital environment." - Estelle Azemard, Vice
President Americas, OVHcloud.Giving companies greater control over their digital journeyIn this age of hybrid
and multi-cloud strategies, the arrival of OVHcloud in the Toronto area offers a real alternative for companies
wishing to diversify and consolidate their cloud infrastructure, based on trusted solutions that meet a variety of

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 3

requirements.Reduced visibility of the macro-economic context calls for optimization of cloud spending, and
OVHcloud meets this challenge with a pricing model that is predictable, has no hidden costs, charges no egress
fees, and includes both inbound and outbound traffic. Enhanced resilience, thanks to a multi-site footprint, this new
data center is particularly well-suited to companies requiring a second, geographically-distant Canadian data center
to deploy their backup or disaster recovery solution. They can rely on the robustness of OVHcloud's own network,
connected to several points of presence (PoPs) in Montreal and Toronto, and more than 40 worldwide.It will also
meet the growing demands of highly regulated industries, increasingly intransigent about data sovereignty. Public
services, healthcare, financial services, professional services, or telecommunications can count on OVHcloud's
exemplary level of compliance with the strict industry certifications (ISO 27001-017-018, SOC 2 Type 2, CSA
Star).An evolving portfolioTo meet these requirements, a varied and competitive range of solutions are now
available in the Cambridge data center:Scale and High Grade dedicated servers, designed for complex
infrastructures and optimized for mission-critical workloads. Powered by the latest AMD and Intel processors, they
meet the new challenges of hyper-convergence, storage, and AI, without compromising on performance and
availability.A complete Object Storage solution compatible with the S3 API, as effective for platform modernization
as for data backup.Network and connectivity options such as Additional IP for application flexibility, and Load
Balancer for efficient load balancing across multiple data centers. Ascent TOR data center has ultra low latency to
the greater Toronto region.The OVHcloud Connect solution, which enables 100% private and highly resilient
interconnection (SLA of 99.99%) of its on-prem infrastructure with the OVHcloud network.And, of course,
emblematic (and free) OVHcloud services, such as the vRack private network, which connects services between
several OVHcloud data centers, or Anti-DDoS to protect infrastructures against computer attacks.In 2024, the
Private Cloud solution leveraging VMware by Broadcom will be added, offering an additional option for companies
wishing to boost their level of resilience by activating Veeam or Zerto virtualized solutions in a 100% dedicated
environment.Building a sustainable digital ecosystemIn a move towards regional integration similar to what it
has been doing in Quebec for over 10 years, OVHcloud is committed to stimulating innovation and helping to build
a trusted digital ecosystem in the Waterloo region - which includes the cities of Waterloo, Cambridge, and
Kitchener. This region is the entrepreneurial heart of the country, and together with Toronto forms an internationally
renowned innovation corridor, the second largest technology hub in North America after Silicon Valley, and one of
the world's top 20 startup ecosystems.As such, start-ups' appetite for cloud computing will naturally find refuge in
the dedicated startup program that OVHcloud makes available to support innovation. Open to all, it offers selected
startups up to $100,000 in infrastructure credits and personalized support based on open, reversible, and
interoperable cloud solutions.Finally, OVHcloud's commitment to sustainability is reflected positively in Ontario,
which is over 90% powered by low-carbon energy sources. Its integrated industrial model and proprietary liquid
cooling technology have enabled it to achieve some of the best energy efficiency ratings in the industry. OVHcloud
is also the only cloud provider to offer its customers the opportunity to measure the carbon footprint of their cloud
services, thanks to a carbon calculator that analyzes the entire lifecycle of their infrastructure, from manufacturing to
operation (scope 1-2-3).Officials and business partners welcome OVHcloud"Late last year, I was pleased to
have the opportunity to meet with Michel Paulin, CEO OVHcloud, and tour the OVHcloud facility as part of the
WREDC mission to Europe. I am proud to welcome OVHcloud to Cambridge as they continue their international
expansion by choosing Cambridge as their second Canadian location. OVHcloud is a leader in the industry and
committed to sustainability, optimizing data center energy consumption through innovative and more efficient
cooling systems, as well as reducing IT components waste. This long-term investment of $145 million helps to
strengthen the Toronto-Waterloo Region Innovation Corridor, the 2nd largest technology corridor cluster in North
America, and continues to position Cambridge as a top-tier destination for technology businesses, talent, and
investors from around the world."- Mayor Jan Liggett, City of Cambridge."OVHcloud is an excellent fit in the
Waterloo region tech ecosystem. An innovative company – a disruptor – that offers sustainable and secure cloud
solutions, OVHcloud is not only an exciting new investment in our community's success but also a respected
partner to the startup community and businesses that value data sovereignty, like cybersecurity, fintech, insurance
and more. Bienvenue dans la région de Waterloo!"- Tony LaMantia, President & CEO of Waterloo EDC."We're
thrilled to have been selected to partner with OVHcloud. The team of engineers kept a customer-first focus and
worked seamlessly together to deliver this unique project that is at the forefront of data center innovation. Our
shared commitment is a testament to delivering unparalleled efficiency and effective solutions for highly secure data
centers, that ultimately navigate the complexities of high-density demands." - Robert Painter,
