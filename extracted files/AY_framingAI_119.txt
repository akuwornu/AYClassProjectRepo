Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, or "GAAP." However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-
term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-
recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures that are prepared in accordance
with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing
operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to evaluate the operating performance
of the Company and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic
planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and
evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and
other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior
periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management's ability to make useful
forecasts. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP
financial measures helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance
to our peers and competitors.

As such, to supplement the GAAP information provided, we present in this press release and during the live
webcast discussing our financial results the following non-GAAP- financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Non-GAAP net income, and Non-GAAP earnings per share ("EPS").

We calculate each of these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:
    •   Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income as reported and adjusts for (i)
        depreciation expense; (ii) amortization of software development costs; (iii) amortization of acquisition-
        related intangibles; (iv) stock-based compensation; (v) severance and other nonrecurring charges; (vi)
        interest expense; (vii) gain on sale of AHT; and (xiii) the provision (benefit) for income taxes.
    •   Adjusted EBITDA Margin - Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above,
        divided by total revenue.
    •   Non-GAAP net income - Non-GAAP net income consists of GAAP net income as reported and adjusts for
        (i) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (ii) stock-based compensation; (iii) severance and
        other non-recurring charges; (iv) non-cash interest expense; (v) gain on sale of AHT; and (vi) the total tax
        effect of items (i) through (v).
    •   Non-GAAP EPS - Non-GAAP EPS consists of Non-GAAP net income, as defined above, divided by
        weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) in the applicable period.

Certain of the items excluded or adjusted to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures are described below:
    •   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Acquisition-related amortization expense is a non-cash
        expense arising primarily from the acquisition of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions or
        investments. We exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from non-GAAP financial measures
        because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the
        underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between
        periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets.
        Investors should note that the use of these intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods
        presented and will contribute to future revenue generation, and the related amortization expense will recur
        in future periods.

                                                                                                    Page 11 of 12
                                TruBridge Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results

    •   Stock-based compensation - Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the
        grant of stock-based awards. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP financial
        measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly
        correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary
        significantly between periods as a result of the timing and valuation of grants of new stock-based awards,
        including grants in connection with acquisitions. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a
        key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods
        presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods, and such expense will recur
        in future periods.
    •   Severance and other nonrecurring charges - Non-recurring charges relate to certain severance and other
        charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered non-recurring. We exclude non-recurring
        expenses (primarily related to costs associated with our recent business transformation initiative and
        transaction-related costs) from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such
        expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business
        operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods.
    •   Non Cash Interest expense - Non-cash interest expense includes amortization of deferred debt issuance
        costs. We exclude non-cash interest expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe
        these non-cash amounts relate to specific transactions and, as such, may not directly correlate to the
        underlying performance of our business operations.
    •   Interest expense: Interest incurred on our term loan and revolving credit facility.
    •   Gain on sale of AHT: Represents the excess of proceeds received over the net assets sold from our sale of
        AHT, our previously wholly-owned post-acute business, in January 2024.
    •   Tax shortfall (windfall) from stock-based compensation - ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-
        Based Payment Accounting, became effective for the Company during the third quarter of 2017 and
        changes the treatment of tax shortfall and excess tax benefits arising from stock based compensation
        arrangements. Prior to ASU 2016-09, these amounts were recorded as an increase (for excess benefits) or
        decrease (for shortfalls) to additional paid-in capital. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these amounts are
        now captured in the period's income tax expense. We exclude this component of income tax expense from
        non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses or benefits in any
        specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations; and (ii)
        such expenses or benefits can vary significantly between periods as a result of the valuation of grants of
        new stock-based awards, the timing of vesting of awards, and periodic movements in the fair value of our
        common stock.

Management considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength
and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends, in particular the extent to
which ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. In addition, management may use Adjusted
EBITDA, Non-GAAP net income and/or Non-GAAP EPS to measure the achievement of performance objectives
under the Company's stock and cash incentive programs. Note, however, that these non-GAAP financial measures
are performance measures only, and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity. Non-GAAP financial
measures are not alternatives for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may
be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts
associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, there is no certainty
that we will not incur expenses in the future that are similar to those excluded in the calculations of the non-GAAP
financial measures presented in this press release. Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the
"Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above.
