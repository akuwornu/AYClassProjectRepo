Unveiling RAFT, a novel model that generated a dataset of 40,000 cyclone events to better assess tropical cyclone-
related risks

The Science

Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) cause enormous damage. Scientists have sought to understand TC risk at local-to-
regional scales. The challenge in understanding that risk lies in the limited historical data and rarity of these storms
making landfall, combined with the high cost of simulating storms using advanced climate models. To overcome
these hurdles, scientists have crafted a new approach that uses a mix of physics, simple math, and advanced
computing (deep neural networks) to create a synthetic record of tropical cyclones. This breakthrough allows them
to simulate tens of thousands of synthetic storms with realistic paths, strengths, and rainfall. This innovative model
provides a richer, more detailed picture of Atlantic tropical cyclone behavior.

The Impact

This study pioneers the use of advanced artificial intelligence to create a detailed synthetic record of TCs, offering
a groundbreaking tool for enhancing our understanding and preparedness for these natural disasters. This
innovative method addresses the critical issue of limited observational data and the prohibitive computational
demands of traditional models. Its contributions promise significant advancements in disaster readiness and
climate risk analysis, potentially benefiting multiple sectors such as urban development, infrastructure planning, and
insurance by refining our capacity to assess and manage the risks posed by TCs.

Summary

TCs pose a significant threat to the socio-economic stability of the U.S. and Caribbean coastal regions, making the
precise assessment of TC risks at local and regional levels crucial. Conventional methods are limited by the brief
historical record of observations and the substantial computational demands of high-resolution climate simulations,

leading to challenges in accurately gauging these risks. To bridge this gap, researchers developed a
groundbreaking database that includes 40,000 synthetic TCs, crafted using the Risk Analysis Framework for
Tropical Cyclones (RAFT) and pioneering the application of advanced artificial intelligence for this purpose. This
comprehensive database not only mirrors the historical patterns of TC tracks and intensities with high fidelity but
also incorporates data on storm-induced rainfall, thus providing an all-encompassing resource for the analysis of
wind and rainfall hazards posed by North Atlantic TCs. Demonstrated by its strong alignment with actual observed
data, researchers methodology marks a pivotal advancement in the meticulous evaluation of TC risks, setting the
stage for enhanced disaster readiness and more strategic risk management approaches. Further research is
ongoing to improve the precipitation simulation and evaluate TC impacts such as urban flooding, power outages,
and damage to infrastructure.
