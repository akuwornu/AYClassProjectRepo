As media proliferates across a growing number of platforms - including OTT streaming services, social media video
channels, direct-to-consumer offerings, interactive content experiences, and traditional linear TV - the media and
entertainment industry faces unprecedented broadcast and video production challenges, pushing traditional media
processing to its limits. Addressing these challenges requires solutions capable of handling this new landscape of
media ingest and delivery, which includes managing diverse formats, ensuring compatibility across numerous
platforms, and meeting varying standards for quality and accessibility, all while streamlining the process to
accommodate the accelerated production and distribution timelines demanded by today's content-hungry
audiences.

At NAB Show 2024 in West Hall (#W1501), Telestream will introduce a new AI-powered suite of media processing
tools engineered to transform how media professionals ingest, enhance, and deliver content, optimizing every step
for speed, quality, and efficiency across the media production lifecycle.

Navigating the Remote Production Challenge

The industry's shift to remote production presents significant challenges for media companies, particularly in
accessing high-resolution, mezzanine content. Telestream's GLIM as a Service, a new cloud-based solution,

streamlines remote content access, eliminating the need for extensive downloads or specialized playback
hardware. By enabling quicker access and simplifying the production process, GLIM as a Service not only
accelerates production workflows but also significantly reduces operational costs by eliminating the reliance on
physical hardware and streamlining content review and approval processes.

Transforming Live Capture in the Cloud

As the demand for live content intensifies, media companies are under mounting pressure not only to quickly
capture and process live feeds for quick broadcasting, but also to navigate the complexity of setting up and
maintaining live capture systems within distributed and remote work environments. Telestream is introducing a new
cloud-based Live Capture as a Service offering that is designed to simplify the live capture of content from any
location in real-time, allowing production teams to bypass the traditional hurdles of remote setup and maintenance.
With this solution, media companies can overcome the limitations of traditional physical infrastructure, facilitating a
faster transition from live capture to broadcast and optimizing production workflows. This new flexibility not only

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 4

accelerates content delivery but also empowers companies to capture and monetize additional content, unhindered
by the physical constraints of onsite infrastructure.

Telestream Chief Product Officer Mike Gilson highlights the benefits of this new solution: "The growing need for live
content underscores the urgency for faster, more flexible production processes. Live Capture as a Service
transforms live content capture by providing cloud-based, instant access, freeing media companies from the
limitations of physical infrastructure. This breakthrough not only streamlines production but also opens up
opportunities for media companies to capture and monetize more content, meeting audience demand for high-
quality, timely media experiences more efficiently."

Elevating Quality Control with Qualify QC

Delivering high-quality content that adheres to stringent standards and formats is increasingly challenging for
content distributors. Telestream is excited to unveil updates to Qualify QC to address these challenges.

What's New:
    •   IMF Compliance: Enhanced with Netflix Photon support, ensuring Interoperable Master Format (IMF)
        packages meet critical industry standards.
    •   Harding FPA Test: Incorporates detection capabilities for potentially epileptic content, prioritizing viewer
        safety.

These enhancements to Qualify QC reflect Telestream's commitment to advancing quality control processes,
making it simpler for media professionals to deliver content that is not only compliant but also of the highest quality
and viewer experience.

New AI-Powered Tools Eliminate Bottlenecks and Accelerate Media Processing Workflows

In today's multi-platform media environment, the rapid delivery of high-quality content across various platforms is a

captions and subtitles. Such delays in content release limit accessibility and global reach at a time when instant
access is paramount. Moreover, a general reluctance to embrace advanced technologies, often perceived as overly
complex, means missed opportunities for streamlining operations, leaving media entities struggling to keep pace
with today's accelerated media consumption rates.

powered media processing tools, marking a significant advancement in the production and distribution of media
content. These solutions are designed to empower production teams, enabling them to produce and distribute high-

        Designer automates the configuration of media processing workflows. This drastically reduces manual
        interventions, streamlines operations, and minimizes errors, significantly speeding up the production cycle.
    •   Intelligent Quality Control (QC): Telestream's AI-driven QC tools automate the process of ensuring
        consistent content quality across large volumes of media. This automation supports the delivery of high-

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 4

        quality content at the speed demanded by multiple platforms, eliminating the scalability challenges of
        manual QC.
    •   Efficient Captioning and Subtitling: The integration of AI also extends to captioning and subtitling
        processes, making them faster and more efficient. This not only enhances content accessibility and global
        reach but also ensures that content can be quickly turned around to meet the immediate needs of a diverse
        and widespread audience.
    •   Simplified Adoption and Integration: Understanding the industry's hesitation towards complex technology
        adoption, Telestream has focused on making its advanced AI solutions accessible and easy to integrate.
