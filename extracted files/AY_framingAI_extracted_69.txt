In 2024, finding a good computing service is something that will solve everything from servers, storage, and
network requirements all the way to your choice of applications and tools for work. It's a major choice and, unwilling
to take any chances, most entrepreneurs and managers opt for Oracle Cloud. Here are the top benefits of this
executive decision, for all those who are still on the fence on whether this is really worth it.

Saving cost and time

The most important thing about the use of Oracle Cloud is the fact that there's no need to maintain servers or
operating systems or employ IT experts on the premises.

All of this makes the entire process a lot cheaper than on-premises infrastructure, which ensures a great ROI.

Another thing you need to focus on is the fact that you get access to a system that's far simpler than on-premise
infrastructure. This means that everything will run more smoothly, and there are fewer things that can potentially go
wrong.

You also get a chance to solve complex tasks at minimal cost. Alternatively, you would have to allocate a lot of
manpower and invest a lot of resources to get the same effect.

Enhanced Data Security

First of all, when it comes to overall data security, you get built-in encryption for data at rest and in transit. This is
the only right way to protect sensitive data and the only way to protect it that remains within compliance.

This way, regular security updates and patches will be applied automatically without you having to be directly
involved in the process. This way, there are no skips or mistakes.

Then, there's the advanced threat detection and monitoring that you have to engage in so that you can keep up with
modern threats. With the help of AI-driven technologies, this becomes more dependable than ever before.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3

Lastly, compliance with industry-specific regulations is important.

Improved Privacy Controls

One of the best ways to improve the security of any organization is to introduce granular access management. In
other words, you get to grant and restrict access based on one's position and on a need-to-know basis. This is
much easier with Oracle Cloud.

These privacy settings available on Oracle Cloud are configurable to your business needs. This means that every
business gets a chance to customize the system to meet their unique needs easily.

Then, you get enhanced user consent management, which allows you to meet compliance demands even in
regions that have stricter laws.

Scalability with Privacy in Mind

One of the biggest problems with privacy (in general) is that the more people know about a thing, the less secure it
becomes. The same is true for digital data privacy. This is why you need a tool that will allow you to scale your data
storage easily without compromising privacy.

The automatic application of pre-set privacy controls as your business grows is one of the most important things
you need to bear in mind. You can't change the settings and make adjustments every time your enterprise grows a
notch. The more autonomous this is, the better.

This will allow you to adapt to increasing regulatory demands, as well as have a secure and scalable access to
sensitive information.

Global Compliance

Modern enterprises, especially online ones, work all over the globe. This means that they have clients from all over
the globe, which also means that they have to be compliant with GDPR and CCPA no matter where they are from.

The use of Oracle Cloud ensures adherence to global privacy standards, as it's a top cloud service developed to be
used by online entities, online businesses, and international enterprises.

Instead of having to resolve data residency issues on your own, you get various compliance options, which makes
your job so much easier.

Overall, you get a simplified approach to GDPR and CCPA compliance, as well as automated compliance reporting
tools.

Disaster Recovery and Privacy Assurance

Then, there's the issue of geo-redundant backups, which allows you to keep all your data safe and sound (and
recoverable), no matter where you choose to work from. This is especially important in the age of digital mobility
and digital nomadism.

When using Oracle Cloud, you'll always have the option of rapid data recovery with privacy protection. This means
that you'll never have to worry about a backup being a potential data liability.

You won't have to look for backups or hope that the backup isn't corrupted, which will significantly minimize the
downtime you'll face.

Customizable Privacy Settings

                                                                                                           Page 3 of 3

Sure, different firms require different types of privacy settings, but sometimes, even within the same agency, you
may need a different approach to privacy settings. Oracle Cloud provides you with options for a tailored privacy
configuration for different departments.

These are flexible privacy policies adaptable to changing needs, and even if you don't plan on using these options,
having them available is always a positive thing.

The fact that you get access to user-defined encryption keys adds an extra layer of randomness to your
cybersecurity, which serves as a serious boost to your enterprise as a whole.

You also get the ability to restrict access based on roles, which is huge, especially in the era of digital work.

Integration with Existing Privacy Frameworks

The most important thing when choosing any tool in 2024 is the seamless integration with your current privacy
tools. After all, you're already using so many tools, and having to replace them because you're moving to a different
system would be a serious problem.

This way, you also get compatibility with third-party privacy solutions. This means that while your cybersecurity is
already at a pretty high level, you always have a simple way to further improve it.

Doing this provides you with consolidated privacy management across platforms, as well as consistent privacy
policies across your IT ecosystem.

Wrap up

Overall, the use of Oracle Cloud will save you time and money. Now, this is something that you'll get with any
managed cloud service but oracle just gives you more in terms of reliability and cybersecurity. This is a far more
significant edge than people give it credit for and a far more compelling reason for migration.
