The World Meteorological Organization issued the following news release:

Prof. Celeste Saulo of Argentina has taken office as the first female and first South American Secretary-General of
the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Key messages

* Prof. Saulo is first female and first South American to head WMO

* Accelerating climate change and more extreme weather are major global threats

* National Meteorological and Hydrological Services must be strengthened

* The most vulnerable must be prioritized

* Partnerships are key to success of Early Warnings for All

She was Director of the National Meteorological Service of Argentina since 2014 and a former First Vice-President
of WMO.

Prof. Saulo will guide WMO towards its vision of a world where all nations, especially the most vulnerable, are more
resilient to extreme weather, climate, water and other environmental events.

She will spearhead the activities of the WMO community to transform science into the best possible services for
society. This includes strengthening observations and data exchange necessary for reliable and accessible weather
forecasts, benefiting from massive advances in artificial intelligence, and expanding Early Warning Services to
protect everyone on Earth.

                                                                                                       Page 2 of 4

Prof. Saulo will also seek to consolidate WMO's monitoring and research of climate change indicators and impacts
in order to inform decision-making on mitigation and adaptation, including through a new pioneering Global
Greenhouse Gas Watch initiative.

"Climate change is the greatest global threat of our times, and increasing inequality exacerbates its impacts". We
just lived through the warmest year on record and 2024 may be even hotter and more extreme once the full impact
of the ongoing El Nino plays out on temperatures and weather events," she says. "Human and industrial activities
are unequivocally to blame."

"Coming from the Global South, I'm acutely aware of the need to do more to prioritize the needs of the most
vulnerable. I am highly motivated to help every National Meteorological and Hydrological Service achieve its
mission to save lives and livelihoods. Most of these services have the experience, knowledge and passion to fulfil
their mandate, but many lack the resources to do so," said Professor Saulo. "Even a small increase in investment
leverages huge socio-economic benefits for our communities."

She says that one of her priorities will be to strengthen WMO's presence at regional level and to empower National
Meteorological and Hydrological services through a "bottom-up approach." She also wants to strengthen
geographical diversity within the WMO Secretariat.

Prof. Saulo is also determined to maintain close relationships with the United Nations family, development
agencies, and the private sector, for instance on the Early Warnings for All initiative. Real leadership and concrete
outcomes are based on solid partnerships.

Prof. Saulo succeeds Prof. Petteri Taalas of Finland who completed his two-term mandate. She was appointed on 1
June 2023 at the quadrennial World Meteorological Congress, the top decision-making body of the 193-Member
WMO. She took office on 1 January 2024.
