ALEXANDRIA, Va., Jan. 17 -- United States Patent no. 11,875,246, issued on Jan. 16, was assigned to SICHUAN
GUANGSHENG IOT TECHNOLOGY Co. LTD. (Chengdu High-Tech Zone, China).

"Intelligent FODAS system and method based on AI chip" was invented by Yunjiang Rao (Chengdu High-tech
Zone, China), Bing Han (Chengdu High-tech Zone, China) and Jingfeng Long (Chengdu High-tech Zone, China).
According to the abstract* released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "The present invention relates to an
intelligent fiber optical distributed acoustic sensing (FODAS) system and method based on an artificial
intelligence (AI) chip, belonging to the field of distributed optical fiber sensing technologies. The system comprises
a light source, a modulator, an optical amplifier, a sensing part, a data processor, a photoelectric detector, and an
alarm unit, where the data processor is specifically an AI chip; the light source, the modulator, the optical amplifier
and port a of a circulator are connected in sequence, port b of the circulator is connected to an optical fiber, port c
of the circulator is connected to the photoelectric detector, an output end of a detector is connected to the data
processor, an output end of the data processor is connected to the alarm unit; and the data processor receives
external acoustic signals and extracts amplitude and frequency features of the external acoustic signals to identify
the type. The present invention can collect the external acoustic signals and identify the signal type thereof, and has
important application value in the fields of perimeter security, disaster warning, geological exploration, and the
like." The patent was filed on Dec. 6, 2019, under Application No. 16/706,034. *For further information, including
