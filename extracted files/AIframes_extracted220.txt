government and the Mainichi newspaperTOKYO, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Representatives of innovative
Japanese startups with global ambitions will be gathering in the heart of Tokyo on March 15. They will showcase
the solutions they offer to help solve the world's biggest social and environmental challenges. A panel of
international experts will assess their growth potential overseas.

 The inaugural Japan Global Innovators' Forum (JGIF) will invite promising Japanese startups from three specific
categories: Age Tech, Disaster Tech, and Clean Energy.Register here→ https://jgif-english.peatix.com/Various
industry experts, ranging from venture capitalists to media professionals and international NGOs, will provide the
Japanese innovators with hands-on feedback and advice on their global expansion plans. The experts will be
joining this event in person or online from overseas.The event is supported by the government of Tokyo,
the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper and the Office of Economy and Commerce at the Spanish Embassy in Japan. It
will be co-hosted by Japan's solutions-focused news service J-Stories and the Mainichi national daily's startup
accelerator, Mainichi Future Creation Lab.The event also aims to explore the latest trends in ESG investment and
facilitate networking, with an emphasis on the need for "inclusive innovation" to address social and environmental
problems sustainably.The organizers intend for the event to become a practical meeting point between aspiring
Japanese startups and their potential partners and supporters overseas, including VCs and CVCs. The event can
also serve as an opportunity for overseas journalists to directly cover Japanese startups and innovators.Toshi

development.He believes they are hampered by a lack of international exposure and that many domestic pitch

president and CEO of Mainichi Future Creation Lab, discusses the growing interest in "zebra companies" that aim
to create a better society through their business, rather than just rapid growth."The theme of this event - Inclusive
Innovation – is born from the idea of creating a more sustainable world where no one is left behind, aligning with the
