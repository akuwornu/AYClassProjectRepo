1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ICF (NASDAQ: ICFI), a global consulting and technology services provider, reported
results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. Commenting on the results, John Wasson, chair and chief
executive officer, said, "We delivered strong performance across all key financial metrics in the second quarter,
demonstrating the benefits of our diversified portfolio and reflecting continued favorable business mix. Revenues
increased 2% year-on-year and increased 6% from last year's levels adjusting for the divestiture of our commercial
marketing business lines in 2023."Similar to the first quarter, our second quarter results were led by robust growth
in higher-margin revenues from commercial energy clients.

We experienced especially strong demand from our utility clients for ICF's core energy efficiency programs as well
as our expanded offerings in priority areas including grid resilience, electrification, decarbonization and flexible load
management, all of which are particularly relevant given the growth in data center demand. Revenues from our
Energy, Environment, Infrastructure and Disaster Recovery client market increased 14% to account for 45% of
ICF's second quarter revenues, compared to its 41% contribution to last year's second quarter revenues."Margin
expansion was a key driver of our strong second quarter earnings. In addition to favorable business mix and higher
utilization, margin performance reflected lower facility costs, together with the benefits of our increased scale. Also,
lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower interest expense enhanced our net income and earnings
per share results for the period."This was a record second quarter of contract awards for ICF, which reached $810
million, representing a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.58 and a trailing twelve-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.40. New
business wins accounted for approximately 55% of our first half awards, demonstrating how well ICF's capabilities
are aligned with client spending priorities. Additionally, an increasing percentage of the value of our year-to-date
awards represented contracts that include an AI component, a good indicator of our recognized expertise in this
high-demand area."Second Quarter 2024 ResultsSecond quarter 2024 total revenue was $512.0 million, a 2.4%
increase from the $500.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2023, and up 6.2% from last year's second
quarter revenues adjusted for the divestiture of our commercial marketing business lines. Subcontractor and other
direct costs were 25.9% of total revenues compared to 27.5% in last year's second quarter. Operating income was

record on September 6, 2024.Summary and Outlook"Following our strong year-to-date performance and based
on our current visibility for continued favorable business mix and utilization metrics, we are pleased to increase our
earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA guidance for full year 2024. Our revised guidance is for GAAP EPS in the
range of $5.60 to $5.90 and Non-GAAP EPS of $6.95 to $7.25, up $0.35 from prior guidance and representing
year-on-year growth of 32.2% and 9.2%, respectively, at the midpoints. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range
between $225 million and $235 million, up from our prior guidance of $220 million to $230 million. The midpoint of
this range will result in ICF achieving the three-year EBITDA objective we provided at our 2022 Investor Day
adjusted for the 2023 divestitures, and we expect to accomplish this with substantially fewer acquisitions than
originally contemplated."Our first half results have put us on track to achieve our full year revenue guidance for
2024. Based on our current visibility, we expect our Energy, Environment, Infrastructure and Disaster Recovery
client market to show robust growth in the second half of this year, continuing to more than offset results in our
Health and Social Programs client market, where gross revenue comparisons have been impacted by lower pass-
through revenues. Operating cash flow guidance remains at approximately $155 million."A growing backlog and our
record business development pipeline of $10.5 billion at the end of the second quarter support our expectations for
continued strong growth in 2024 and give us confidence in ICF's ability to continue to grow at a high single-digit rate
in the coming years. We are experiencing high demand from commercial clients for our energy and environmental
expertise and implementation skills. We have excellent credentials to assist state and local government clients in
meeting their planning, resilience and mitigation objectives, as well as supporting their disaster recovery efforts.
We also have significantly expanded our capabilities in areas in the federal government that have bipartisan
support, particularly IT modernization, which remains an area of priority spending."We appreciate the tremendous
contributions of our staff in driving the success of ICF by supporting our clients with multi-disciplinary advisory work
and cross-cutting implementation skills. Their passion for their work and for the impact it has on society is ICF's
'secret sauce'," Mr. Wasson concluded.About ICFICF is a global consulting and technology services company with

involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties are "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may concern our current expectations about our future
results, plans, operations and prospects and involve certain risks, including those related to the government
contracting industry generally; our particular business, including our dependence on contracts with U.S. federal
government agencies; and our ability to acquire and successfully integrate businesses. These and other factors that
could cause our actual results to differ from those indicated in forward-looking statements that are included in the

update these statements in the future.Note on Forward-Looking Non-GAAP MeasuresThe company does not
reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to the
variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and because not all of the information
necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures (such as the
effect of share-based compensation or the impact of future extraordinary or non-recurring events like acquisitions)
is available to the company without unreasonable effort. For the same reasons, the company is unable to estimate
the probable significance of the unavailable information. The company provides forward-looking non-GAAP financial
measures that it believes will be achievable, but it cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted
calculations, and the U.S. GAAP financial measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP financial
measures.Investor Contacts:Lynn Morgen, ADVISIRY PARTNERS,+1.212.750.5800David Gold, ADVISIRY
