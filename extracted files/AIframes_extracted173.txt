Body

American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year
ended December 31, 2023.

AIG Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino said: "In 2023, AIG delivered outstanding financial results,
highlighted by excellent underwriting performance and the successful execution of multiple complex initiatives, while
delivering exceptional value for our clients and stakeholders. Our substantial progress reflects the dedication and
teamwork of our AIG colleagues around the world, who have delivered on our objectives. The full year adjusted
after-tax income per diluted share increased 33% from the prior year to $6.79. We have further repositioned AIG for
the future with the divestitures of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, and we enter 2024 with significant
momentum.

"General Insurance delivered $2.3 billion of underwriting income in 2023, a 15% increase year-over-year. Our
unwavering commitment to underwriting excellence and ability to manage volatility remain fundamental to the
sustainability of AIG's underwriting income growth. The full-year 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% represents an
improvement of 130 basis points year-over-year. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, of 87.7% represents an
improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year. 2023 margins and underwriting income were the best results
achieved in recent history. The quality of the underwriting portfolio once again enabled exceptional success at
January 1 in renewing our reinsurance placements.

"For the full-year 2023, General Insurance net premiums written increased 5% year-over-year, or 7% on a
comparable basis, driven by 5% growth in Commercial Lines led by 17% growth in Lexington and 10% in Global

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 29

Specialty. For the fourth quarter, North America Commercial Lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure,
increased 7% and remains ahead of loss cost trend. Global Commercial pricing increased 6% and was in-line with
loss cost trend.

"Life & Retirement continued to deliver strong financial results, benefiting from continued spread expansion and
strong sales with total premiums and deposits exceeding $40 billion for the full year. Base net investment income
continued to see favorable outcomes from the higher interest rate environment and, for the full-year 2023, Individual
and Group Retirement produced a 46 basis point expansion in base spread year-over-year.

"With three successful secondary offerings in 2023, we reduced AIG's ownership in Corebridge to approximately
52% at year end. We expect to deconsolidate Corebridge in 2024, which will bring greater visibility into our
business, capital structure and operations.

"AIG's strong performance and strategic actions in 2023 supported our sustained and balanced capital
management strategy. We maintained financial flexibility while reducing financial debt by $1.4 billion and returning
approximately $4 billion to AIG shareholders through $3 billion of common stock repurchases and $1 billion of
dividends, including a 12.5% increase in the common stock dividend in the second quarter of 2023.

"We have significant momentum as we enter 2024, and excellent underwriting, operations, claims service, and
talent are what will drive AIG's continued growth. As we continue to navigate an increasingly complex global risk
environment, we will remain agile and disciplined while delivering sustainable and differentiated value to our
customers, partners and stakeholders."

For full year 2023, net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $3.6 billion, or $4.98 per diluted
common share, compared to $10.2 billion, or $12.94 per diluted common share, in the prior year. The decline was
primarily driven by net realized losses largely related to Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative at Life
and Retirement (L&R) compared to gains in the prior year, as well as derivative activity.

AATI was $4.9 billion, or $6.79 per diluted common share, for the full year of 2023 compared to $4.0 billion, or
$5.12 per diluted common share, in the prior year. The increase in AATI was due to higher underwriting income and
net investment income in General Insurance. While L&R APTI rose 15% in 2023, Corebridge's earnings included in
AATI decreased 20% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 77.7% at the beginning of the year to 52.2% at
December 31, 2023.

For the fourth quarter of 2023, net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $86 million, or $0.12 per
diluted common share, compared to $545 million, or $0.72 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The
decline was primarily driven by higher net realized losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative.

AATI was $1.3 billion, or $1.79 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.1 billion, or
$1.39 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The increase in AATI was driven by higher net
investment income in General Insurance. Corebridge's earnings included in AATI decreased about 25% due to the
reduction in AIG ownership.

Total net investment income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.9 billion, an increase of 21% from $3.3 billion in
the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loans due to higher
reinvestment rates, partially offset by lower returns on alternative investments. Total net investment income on an
APTI basis* was $3.5 billion, an increase of $499 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the same trends.

Book value per common share was $65.14 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 16% from September 30, 2023
and an increase of 18% from December 31, 2022, both primarily driven by a decrease in accumulated other
comprehensive loss (AOCL) and the impact of share repurchases. Adjusted book value per common share* was
$76.65, a decrease of 2% from September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the impact of Corebridge secondary
offerings, and an increase of 1% from December 31, 2022, reflecting net impact of income, dividends, share
repurchases and Corebridge secondary offerings.

                                                                                                 Page 3 of 29

In the fourth quarter of 2023, AIG repurchased $1.0 billion of common stock, or approximately 16 million shares,
paid $256 million of common and preferred dividends and repurchased $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of
debt. AIG parent liquidity was $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, up $4.0 billion from September 30, 2023, which
includes insurance subsidiary dividends and proceeds from Corebridge secondary offerings and the sale of Validus
Re. Total debt and preferred stock to total capital ratio at December 31, 2023 was 28.5%, down from 33.7% at
September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in AOCL. Excluding AOCL adjusted for cumulative unrealized
gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, total debt and preferred stock to total capital ratio*
was 24.3% at December 31, 2023, down from 25.9% at September 30, 2023.

On February 13, 2024, the AIG Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on AIG common stock of
$0.36 per share. The dividend is payable on March 28, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on
March 14, 2024.

The AIG Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $365.625 per share on AIG Series A 5.85%
Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock), with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
share, which is represented by depositary shares (NYSE: AIG PRA), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a
share of preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares will receive $0.365625 per depositary share. The dividend is
payable on March 15, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on February 29, 2024.

On January 31, 2024, AIG announced that it will redeem all of the 20,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock and all 20,000,000 of the corresponding depositary shares on March 15, 2024. The redemption price per
share of Series A Preferred Stock will be $25,000 (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share).

   •     On November 1, 2023, AIG closed the sale of Validus Re. As a result of this sale, only one month of
         activity of Validus Re was included in General Insurance fourth quarter 2023 results, compared to a full
         quarter in 2022.

                                                                                                   Page 6 of 29

   •     General Insurance APTI of $1.4 billion increased $225 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher
         net investment income, improved accident year losses and lower catastrophe-related charges, partially
         offset by lower favorable prior year development (PYD) and higher general operating expenses (GOE).
   •     Fourth quarter 2023 NPW of $5.8 billion increased 3% from the prior year quarter, or 7% on a comparable
         basis, driven by 5% growth in Commercial Lines and 9% growth in Personal Insurance. North America
         Commercial Lines NPW declined 7% from the prior year quarter on a reported basis, but grew 5% on a
         comparable basis, reflecting continued positive rate changes, higher renewal retentions and strong new
         business production in Lexington, Retail Property and Casualty, partially offset by a decline in Financial
         Lines premiums reflecting our continued underwriting discipline. International Commercial Lines delivered
         8% NPW growth from the prior year quarter, or 6% on a comparable basis, attributable to continued rate
         increases, strong renewal retention, and robust new business production in Property and Global Specialty,
         partially offset by a decrease in Financial Lines. Global Personal Insurance NPW increased 10% from the
         prior year quarter, or 9% on a comparable basis, primarily driven by Private Client Select resulting from
         changes in our reinsurance program, partially offset by a decrease in Travel.
   •     Fourth quarter 2023 underwriting income increased $7 million from the prior year quarter to $642 million,
         and included $122 million of total catastrophe-related charges, representing 2.1 loss ratio points, of which
         $54 million was in North America and $68 million in International. Fourth quarter 2023 underwriting also
         included favorable PYD, net of reinsurance, of $69 million compared to favorable PYD, net of reinsurance,
         of $151 million in the prior year quarter. The amortization of the adverse development cover totaled $41
         million in the fourth quarter 2023, flat with the fourth quarter 2022.
   •     The combined ratio improved 0.8 points from the prior year quarter to 89.1%, driven by a 2.0 point
         decrease in the loss ratio to 56.5%. The AYCR improved 0.5 points from the prior year quarter to 87.9%,
         driven by a 1.7 point decrease in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted* (AYLR) to 55.3%, reflecting
         continued earn-in of premium rate increases in excess of loss cost trends and continued benefit from the
         business mix shift. The expense ratio was 32.6%, a 1.2 point increase from the prior year quarter, largely
         from an increase in GOE ratio.
   •     The North America Commercial Lines combined ratio increased 0.7 points from the prior year quarter to
         85.1%, driven by lower favorable PYD and a higher GOE ratio. The AYCR improved 1.6 points to 84.3%,
         driven by a 2.7 point improvement in the AYLR to 60.3%.
   •     International Commercial Lines combined ratio improved 3.9 points from the prior year quarter to 85.5%,
         driven by lower catastrophe losses and an improvement in the acquisition ratio, mainly attributable to
         changes in the business mix and improved commission terms. The AYCR improved 1.3 points to 80.3%,
         primarily driven by the improvement in acquisition ratio.
   •     The North America Personal Insurance combined ratio improved 0.7 points from the prior year quarter to
         101.8% and the AYCR increased 4.1 points to 109.4%, primarily driven by an increase in AYLR due to
         changes in business mix. The International Personal Insurance combined ratio improved 1.2 points from
         the prior year quarter to 97.7%, driven by a 3.9 point improvement in the loss ratio, partially offset by a 2.7
         point increase in the expense ratio. The AYCR increased 0.2 points to 99.1% as the 2.5 point improvement
         in the AYLR was offset by the higher GOE ratio.
   •     Net investment income on an APTI basis was $795 million, an increase of 38% from the prior year quarter
         driven by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loans.

Life and Retirement
   •     In the fourth quarter 2023, AIG completed two secondary offerings of Corebridge common stock, receiving
         proceeds of $1.7 billion and reducing AIG's ownership to 52.2%. L&R results are presented before the
         impact of non-controlling interests on AATI. L&R's contribution to AATI was $362 million, a decrease from
         $494 million in the prior year quarter.
   •     L&R APTI increased $105 million from the prior year quarter to $957 million. The increase was primarily
         due to higher base portfolio spread income as a result of higher base portfolio yields, partially offset by
         lower alternative investment income and higher mortality in the Life Insurance segment. Base net

          investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with a 23 basis point combined
          improvement year-over-year.
    •     Premiums grew 19% from the prior year quarter to $2.5 billion due to higher pension risk transfer volumes.
          Premiums and deposits* increased 20% to $10.6 billion. Fixed and Fixed Index Annuities sales for the
          quarter were up 55% and Institutional Markets also had strong sales, supported by $1.9 billion of pension
          risk transfer transactions, partially offset by lower sales of Variable Annuities.
    •     Net investment income on an APTI basis was $2.6 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year quarter
          driven by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loans.

Other Operations
    •     Corporate and Other APTL, excluding Corebridge, improved $121 million from the prior year quarter,
          largely due to higher income on parent short-term investments, lower general operating expenses and
          lower AIG interest expenses driven by debt reduction in 2023.
    •     Corebridge Other Operations APTL deteriorated $65 million from the prior year quarter. This was driven by
          the Asset Management Group, which includes the consolidated results of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs),
          recording a $97 million increase in APTL from the prior year quarter, largely due to lower interest income
          and net losses associated with VIEs compared to net gains in the prior year quarter. Corebridge Corporate
          general operating expenses and interest expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior year
          quarter.

COMMENT ON REGULATION G AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Throughout this press release, including the financial highlights, AIG presents its financial condition and results of
operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of its business results. Some of the
measurements AIG uses are "Non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the
acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures AIG
presents are listed below and may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Regulation G
are included within the relevant tables attached to this news release or in the Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial
Supplement available in the Investors section of AIG's website, www.aig.com .

                                                                                                Page 11 of 29

Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms "AIG," "we," "us" and "our"
to refer to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.

AIG uses the following operating performance measures because AIG believes they enhance the understanding of
the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG's business segments. AIG believes they also
allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. When AIG uses these measures,
reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis.

Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) adjusted for the
cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets (DTA)
(Adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share
basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1)
of AIG's available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3)
due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign
currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the
asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is
largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative
unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets held by AIG in support of Fortitude Re's
reinsurance obligations to AIG post deconsolidation of Fortitude Re (Fortitude Re funds withheld assets) since
these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets
representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not
yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As
net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in
these book value per common share metrics. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total
AIG common shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related
to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and DTA (Adjusted common shareholders' equity), by total common shares
outstanding.

Book Value per Common Share, Excluding Goodwill, Value of Business Acquired (VOBA), Value of Distribution
Channel Acquired (VODA), Other Intangible Assets, AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses
related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) (Adjusted Tangible Book Value per
Common Share) is used to provide more accurate measure of the realizable value of shareholder on a per-common
share basis. Adjusted Tangible Book Value per Common Share is derived by dividing Total AIG common
shareholders' equity, excluding intangible assets, AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses
related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and DTA (Adjusted Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity), by total
common shares outstanding.

AIG Return on Common Equity (ROCE) - Adjusted After-tax Income Excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative
unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and DTA (Adjusted return on common
equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity. We believe this measure is useful to
investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair
value (1) of AIG's available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk
and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts,
foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates
the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein
there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative
unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are
economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to
net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim
periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and
foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted Return on Common Equity.
Adjusted Return on Common Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income
attributable to AIG common shareholders by average Adjusted Common Shareholders' Equity.

General Insurance and Life and Retirement Adjusted Segment Common Equity is based on segment equity
adjusted for the attribution of debt and preferred stock (Segment Common Equity) and is consistent with AIG's
Adjusted Common Shareholders' Equity definition.

General Insurance and Life and Retirement Return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity - Adjusted After-tax
Income (Return on adjusted segment common equity) is used to show the rate of return on Adjusted Segment
Common Equity. Return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized Adjusted
After-tax Income by Average Adjusted Segment Common Equity.

Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to General Insurance and Life and Retirement is derived by subtracting
attributed interest expense, income tax expense and attributed dividends on preferred stock from APTI. Attributed
debt and the related interest expense and dividends on preferred stock are calculated based on our internal
allocation model. Tax expense or benefit is calculated based on an internal attribution methodology that considers
among other things the taxing jurisdiction in which the segments conduct business, as well as the deductibility of
expenses in those jurisdictions.

Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included
in Other income for GAAP purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits
(included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes) and income from elimination of the International reporting
lag. Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our segments.

Adjusted Pre-tax Income (APTI) is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing
operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one
or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or
operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and
measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded
items include the following:
    •     changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;
    •     net change in market risk benefits (MRBs);
    •     changes in benefit reserves related to net realized gains and losses;
    •     changes in the fair value of equity securities;
    •     net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;
    •     following deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld
          assets;
    •     loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;
    •     all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement
          accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication.
          Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific
          APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest
          credited to policyholder account balances);
    •     income or loss from discontinued operations;
    •     net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);
    •     pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;
    •     net gain or loss on divestitures and other;
    •     non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;

                                                                                                   Page 13 of 29

    •     restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve
          efficiency and simplify our organization;
    •     the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk
          under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;
    •     integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;
    •     losses from the impairment of goodwill;
    •     non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes
          or changes to accounting principles; and
    •     income from elimination of the international reporting lag.

Adjusted After-tax Income attributable to AIG common shareholders (AATI) is derived by excluding the tax effected
APTI adjustments described above, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains
(losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG:
    •     deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;
    •     changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our
          current businesses or operating performance; and
    •     net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

See page 15 for the reconciliation of Net income attributable to AIG to Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to
AIG.

Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and
the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that
describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for
General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would
be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100
indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under
GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The
underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which
affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and
competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and
associated ratios.

Accident year loss and Accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident
year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude
catastrophe losses (CATs) and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium
adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic
events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such
as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are
meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact
of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. We also exclude prior year development to
provide transparency related to current accident year results.

Underwriting ratios are computed as follows:
    •     Loss ratio = Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred ÷ Net premiums earned (NPE)
    •     Acquisition ratio = Total acquisition expenses ÷ NPE
    •     General operating expense ratio = General operating expenses ÷ NPE
    •     Expense ratio = Acquisition ratio + General operating expense ratio

                                                                                                   Page 14 of 29

    •     Combined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratio
    •     CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred - (CATs)] ÷ [NPE
          +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes] - Loss ratio
    •     Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (AYLR ex-CAT) = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred -
          CATs - PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums +
          Adjustment for ceded premium under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years]
    •     Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR ex-CAT) = AYLR ex-CAT + Expense ratio
    •     Prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment
          expenses incurred - CATs - PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior
          year premiums] - Loss ratio - CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio.

Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance
policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life,
investment-type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank funding agreements and mutual funds. We believe the
measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product
trends and our sales performance period over period.

Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.
