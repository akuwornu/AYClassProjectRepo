World Backup DayHOBOKEN, N.J., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- On March 31, World Backup Day
reminds us to regularly back up our digital data. "Due to increasing Cyber Attacks, organizations should back up, or
copy, their digital data frequently to protect against cyber threats," advises Carl Mazzanti, President ofeMazzanti
Technologies. "IT support providers can create affordable cloud backup and other solutions to prevent data loss
from errors, disasters, or Cyber Attacks," he explains.Data backups are vital for Cyber Security in movies,
businesses, and organizations.

Make sure to include them in your solutions. A trusted IT services provider can help you design effective backup,
restoration and other plans.Bad actors or nation-states are often behind these attacks, and "increasingly, insurance
companies want proof of backup plans to protect against Cyber Attacks likeransomware," Mazzanti adds.He notes
that Toy Story 2, a popular Pixar movie, almost didn't happen because a mistake deleted most of the digital files
while making the future hit. "Fortunately, Pixar had backup files, so the production moved ahead smoothly,"
Mazzanti notes. "Close calls like that helped to prompt the creation of World Backup Day, which serves as a
reminder to back up our digital files and help prevent the permanent loss of important data."Best practices
include:Automating backups, so they occur frequently and repeatedly.Securing copied data. Protect your backups
by encrypting and storing them in various locations, like the cloud, to keep them safe and easily
accessible.Restoration, or creating a plan to retrieve your data.Disaster recovery plans need to have steps for
dealing with security incidents. These steps should include who to contact first, assessing the damage, and
promptly informing customers.Organizations that use best practices fordata backupcan trust that they have a
comprehensive solution for data protection that integrates with Cyber Security. "Talk to your Cyber Security partner
to find the best backup options for your systems," advises Mazzanti. "Data backups are vital for Cyber Security in
