capabilities to enhance business continuity and help address Spain's and the EU's regulations and requirements for
data residency, in addition to industry-specific requirements and regulations such as the Digital Operational
Resilience Act (DORA) in the financial services sector. Financial services organizations face unique regulatory
requirements due to the fact that their workloads are inherently sensitive, and Oracle has developed capabilities
and practices to help customers in the financial services sector address requirements for DORA and other key
industry regulations. As part of continuing efforts to help financial services customers perform their due diligence,

Oracle Cloud Regions – including the existing region and upcoming region in Madrid, as well as the EU Sovereign
Cloud Region in Madrid – offer backup and disaster recovery solutions to help address customers' need for data

achieve AI sovereignty by gaining the assurance that their use of AI is aligned with data sovereignty
frameworks.OCI's unique cloud architecture enables Oracle to deploy dedicated cloud regions with hyperscale
cloud services inside customer data centers and deploy more public cloud regions faster by starting with an optimal
footprint and scaling as needed. This approach helps meet the needs of all countries and markets without
compromising cloud capabilities, while also providing the consistent performance, SLAs, and global pricing for
which OCI has become known.Leading Organizations in Spain Welcome the Upcoming Public Cloud

combining the best capabilities of both companies," said Sergio Sánchez, operations, network and IT director,
Telefónica España. "On the one hand, we continue to migrate part of our mission-critical infrastructure to Oracle's
cloud to be more agile in delivering innovative products and services to our customers around the world. On the
other hand, this is the third cloud region for which we have been trusted as a host partner, again positioning us as a
leader in the data center industry.""We rely on Oracle to migrate our critical workloads to Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure while complying with local regulatory requirements. OCI provides us with a robust and secure cloud
infrastructure," said Enríque Rodríguez, director of technology services, Banco Sabadell. "The arrival of the third

AI across different areas of our business.""Naturgy is migrating a large part of its critical data infrastructure to OCI,
which we selected for its scalability, performance, and price competitiveness," said Rafael Blesa, general manager
of information systems, Naturgy. "The upcoming arrival of Oracle's third cloud region in Spain is great news as it will

to remain relevant and competitive," said Ravin Dhalani, CIO, MASORANGE. "Cloud technologies play a critical
