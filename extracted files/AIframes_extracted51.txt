In the future, networks incorporating high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) will support disaster communications,
ship and drone connectivity, and communications in mountainous and remote areas. The exhibit will showcase the
latest technologies for non-terrestrial network (NTN) HAPS and underwater drones for mobile coverage beyond the
reach of conventional terrestrial network areas, from remote seas to low-orbit space.

Next-generation cloud slicing and 5GC on AWS to meet specific network needs
Tailoring networks to meet specific quality-of-service requirements remains a challenge. This innovative solution
combines end-to-end orchestration, QoS visualization and monitoring, and 5G Core from AWS to deliver flexible
network quality for specific locations and time scenarios. By integrating the cloud, energy efficiency and on-demand
network quality, the solution will help realize highly sustainable networks.

5G application to address diverse mobile needs in industrial settings
The adoption of 5G in the industrial sector is still limited. More extensive 5G implementation in the industrial world
will require comprehensive analysis and multi-dimensional verification that can address diverse mobile needs and
environments. DOCOMO has developed an advanced yet portable simulator that makes it easy to visualize 5G
wireless transmission characteristics and electromagnetic interference effects in each customer's unique industrial
setting.

Generative AI

Enlivening the metaverse with generative AI that creates non-player characters

The world-first technology from DOCOMO uses generative AI to create non-player characters in the metaverse.
The innovative technology, which automatically generates each character's appearance, behavior and role to
eliminate the need for experts with specialized know-how, will help realize more enriched metaverse experiences in
the future.
