The Preservation and Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement (PRICE) program provides support for
residents of manufactured housing, including manufactured home communities. The program provides grants for

                                                                                              Page 2 of 15

infrastructure, planning, resident and community services, resiliency, and other assistance, including land and site
acquisition.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommendation provides $10,000,000 for the PRICE program. The Committee continues to direct
the Department, to the extent practicable, to fund grants in a variety of geographic areas, including urban and rural
communities, Tribal communities, and areas prone to natural disasters.

PRICE implementation.--The PRICE program is a first-of-its- kind opportunity to, among other eligible activities,
replace manufactured housing communities with affordable housing, which will create more housing opportunities
for low- to moderately low-income families. The Committee notes that the PRICE program is also eligible for
resiliency activities, including the reconstruction or repair of manufactured housing and manufactured housing
communities (MHCs) to protect the health and safety of manufactured housing residents. For pre-1976 mobile
homes, funds made available under the PRICE program may be used only for replacement housing. The
Committee continues to direct HUD to encourage grantees to ensure that replacement housing is affordable.

The Committee continues to encourage the Department to prioritize applications that preserve long-term housing
affordability options for low- and medium-income residents of manufactured housing or MHCs, including
replacement housing for pre-1976 mobile homes. The Committee directs HUD to provide a report, within 180 days
of enactment of this Act, reflecting on the successes and areas of improvement of the first NOFO for the PRICE
program, including where the program succeeded in replacing unsafe housing in areas with extreme weather,
natural hazards, and disaster events.

SELF-HELP AND ASSISTED HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024... $60,000,000

Budget request, fiscal year 2025... 54,700,000

Recommended in the bill... 56,000,000

Bill compared with:

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024... -4,000,000

Budget request, fiscal year 2025... +1,300,000

The self-help and assisted homeownership opportunity program account funds several programs. The self-help
homeownership opportunity program (SHOP) supports low-income homeownership by providing funding to non-
profit organizations and consortia that utilize the sweat-equity model to build housing for first-time homeowners.
Funds are distributed through grants for land acquisition and improvements associated with developing new, quality
housing for low-income people. This account also funds the capacity building for affordable housing and community
development program, known as section 4, and assistance to rural communities, as authorized by the HUD
Demonstration Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-120), which provides grants to build and expand the capacity of non-profit
organizations to develop affordable housing and carry out community development activities that benefit low-
income persons.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommendation provides $56,000,000 for the self-help and assisted homeownership opportunity
program account. The following table provides funding levels for activities within this account:

Homeless assistance grants provide funding for programs under title IV of the McKinney Act, as amended by the
Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009. HEARTH Act programs
include the continuum of care (CoC) competitive grants, the emergency solutions grants (ESG) program, and the
rural housing stability grants program.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $4,060,000,000 for homeless assistance grants. Funding is provided in the amounts
shown in the following table:

[View table in the link at bottom.]

Addressing the needs of survivors of domestic violence.-- The Committee recommendation includes not less than
$52,000,000 in competitive CoC grants for victim service to assist survivors of domestic violence, dating violence,
sexual assault, or stalking. The Committee recommends that such projects be eligible for renewal under the
Continuum of Care program, subject to the same terms and conditions as other renewal applicants. It is the
expectation of the Committee that HUD will work with continuums of care to ensure that such projects do not
supplant projects eligible for renewal as part of the 2025 Continuum of Care grant competition.

Barriers to accessing temporary housing.--The Committee recognizes that there are many barriers for the homeless
to seek shelter, including a lack of personal documentation (like a birth certificate or a Social Security card). The
Committee encourages HUD to work with CoCs and other stakeholders to assess these challenges and continue to
respond accordingly.

Improving the Continuum of Care program.--The Committee notes an October 19, 2022 HUD Inspector General
report entitled "HUD Could Improve Its Tracking and Monitoring of Continuum of Care Grantee Spending Levels"
(2023-LA-0002), which yielded two priority open recommendations related to improving the CoC program. While the
Committee is pleased to see that one of the two priority open recommendations has been closed, the Committee
urges the Department to close the second one, which is centered on designing and implementing a training
program and other development tools for grantees.

Furthermore, HUD is directed to prepare a report, within one year of enactment, which identifies areas of success
and room for opportunity within the CoC program. The report must include trends in homelessness, with an
emphasis on unsheltered homelessness and an analysis of individuals who have participated in the CoC program
and successfully achieved market-rate housing. The report should also assess the impact of the two-year notice of
funding opportunity (NOFO) provided for in P.L. 118-42, as well as the CoC grant renewal process more generally.
This report should be done in consultation with stakeholders.

Strategic funding for homelessness.--The Committee recognizes that although there are currently record-high
Federal resources dedicated to addressing homelessness, including in this recommendation, the number of
unhoused Americans has increased over the past ten years. In particular, there has been a rapid growth in the
number of public encampments and individuals with substance use disorders. The Committee encourages the
Department to evaluate the efficacy of current policies and consider new policies that lead toward better outcomes,

                                                                                              Page 4 of 15

                           Appropriations Bill, 2025 - Title II - HUD (Part 7 of 13)

prioritizing programs that require treatment for substance abuse and mental health, accountability, and a path to
self-sufficiency.

Undocumented homeless individuals.--The Committee recognizes that recent immigration patterns have led to
severe spikes in homelessness nationwide. Of the amounts in the CoC program made available for technical
assistance, HUD is directed to provide up to $2,500,000 to CoCs in support to respond to these recent trends to
build capacity.

PROJECT-BASED RENTAL ASSISTANCE

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024... $16,010,000,000

Of which designated as emergency... 2,000,000,000

Budget request, fiscal year 2025... 16,686,000,000

Of which designated as emergency... 5,081,790,000

Recommended in the bill... 16,595,000,000

Bill compared with:

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024... +585,000,000

Budget request, fiscal year 2025... -91,000,000

The project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account provides a rental subsidy to private landlords tied to a specific
housing unit so that the properties themselves, rather than the individual living in the unit, remain subsidized. PBRA
provides safe, stable, and affordable housing to over 1,300,000 low- income and very low-income households at
approximately 17,700 multifamily housing properties each year. Funding provided through this account supports the
renewal of expiring project- based contracts, including section 8, moderate rehabilitation, and single room
occupancy contracts; amendments to section 8 project-based contracts; and administrative costs for contract
administration.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommendation provides $16,595,000,000 for the project-based rental assistance account to
support the annual renewals and amendments of project-based contracts. This is an increase of $585,000,000
above the fiscal year 2024 level. Of the total funds provided, up to $468,000,000 is for the cost of contract
administrators, the same as the fiscal year 2024 level.

Performance-based contract administrators (PBCAs).--The Committee appreciates HUD's efforts to work with
relevant stakeholders to develop new PBCA arrangements before the existing agreements expire. The Committee
recommendation includes authority for HUD to award contracts through a procurement process that will ensure
effective and efficient oversight and monitoring of the PBRA program while maintaining safe, stable, and affordable
housing for over 1,300,000 households living in PBRA properties.

Property oversight.--The Committee is concerned about serious breakdowns in Section 8 housing property owner
and property management oversight procedures such as the case in Toledo, Ohio during 2023 and into 2024,
where tenants suffered severe neglect for months as the property was functionally abandoned by the owner and
manager. The Committee understands HUD has been working with the owners on corrective actions. Within 30
days of the enactment of this Act, the Committee requests HUD to brief the Committee on where the oversight and
subsequent response process broke down, what HUD will do prevent such an incident from occurring again, and
how HUD plans to ensure that full services are restored and maintained without interruption moving forward.

                                                                                              Page 5 of 15

The housing for the elderly (section 202) program provides eligible private, non-profit organizations with capital
grants to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of housing intended for low-income, elderly people.
In addition, the program provides project-based rental assistance contracts (PRAC) to support operational costs for
units constructed under the program.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $931,400,000 for housing for the elderly, which will fully fund contract renewals and
amendments. This is an increase of $18,400,000 above the fiscal year 2024 level and the same as the budget
request. Within the total amount provided, up to $115,000,000 is provided for service coordinators and the
continuation of congregate services grants to provide supportive services for residents.

HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024... $208,000,000

Budget request, fiscal year 2025... 256,700,000

The housing for persons with disabilities (section 811) program provides eligible private, non-profit organizations
with capital grants to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of supportive housing for disabled
persons and provides project-based rental assistance to support operational costs for such units.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $256,700,000 for section 811 activities, which will fully fund project rental assistance
and project assistance contract renewals and amendments. This is an increase of $48,700,000 above the fiscal
year 2024 level and the same as the budget request.

The Housing Counseling Assistance program, authorized under section 106 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, works with a nationwide network of housing counseling agencies and counselors to
provide tools to current and prospective homeowners and renters so that they can make responsible choices to
address their housing needs. Housing counseling services range from addressing homelessness and preventing
foreclosures and evictions to planning for first-time home purchases. Housing counselors also provide assistance to
victims of natural disasters.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $57,500,000 for housing counseling, the same as the fiscal year 2024 level and the
budget request.

Public facing reporting.--The Committee directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to, within 180
days of the enactment of this Act, make available electronically in a publicly accessible and downloadable format all
HUD Form 9902 reports from Local Housing Counseling Agencies, Multi-State Housing Agencies, and State
Housing Agencies from the previous fiscal quarter, and thereafter, in accordance with program regulatory reporting
requirements.

PAYMENT TO MANUFACTURED HOUSING FEES TRUST FUND

The Office of Manufactured Housing Programs (OMHP) establishes and enforces Federal standards for the design
and construction of manufactured homes to assure quality, durability, safety, and affordability. All manufactured
homes are required to meet the Federal standards, and fees are charged to producers to cover the costs of
administering the program.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $14,000,000 for the manufactured housing standards programs, to be funded from
fees collected and deposited into the manufactured housing fees trust fund account. No funding is provided for
grants to facilitate enforcement of energy standards as requested in the budget.

Federal Housing Administration

available to borrowers whom the conventional market perceives as bearing more risk, including first-time
homebuyers, minorities, lower-income families, and residents of underserved areas.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends a limitation of $1,000,000 for direct loans and $400,000,000,000 for guaranteed loans,
the same as fiscal year 2024 enacted levels. The Committee provides $150,000,000 for administrative contract
expenses, the same as the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.

FHA multifamily loan production.--FHA's production of rental housing units has decreased more than 50 percent in
the last two years. The Committee encourages HUD to continue to take steps to deliver on its Strategic Plan goal of
increasing the supply of housing. The Committee requests HUD to provide quarterly updates on FHA multifamily
production numbers and any specific changes FHA has made to increase rental housing supply.

TABLE: GENERAL AND SPECIAL RISK PROGRAM ACCOUNT

The FHA's general insurance and special risk insurance (GI and SRI) program account includes 17 different
programs administered by FHA. The GI fund includes a wide variety of insurance programs for special-purpose
single and multifamily loans, including loans for property improvements, manufactured housing, multifamily rental
housing, condominiums, housing for the elderly, hospitals, group practice facilities, and nursing homes. The SRI
fund includes insurance programs for mortgages in older, declining urban areas that would not be otherwise eligible
for insurance, mortgages with interest reduction payments, and mortgages for experimental housing and for high-
risk mortgagors who would not normally be eligible for mortgage insurance without housing counseling.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends a limitation of $1,000,000 for direct loans and $35,000,000,000 for guaranteed loans,
the same as fiscal year 2024 enacted levels.

Government National Mortgage Association

GUARANTEES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM ACCOUNT

[View table in the link at bottom.]

The Government National Mortgage Association guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on
mortgage-backed securities issued by private institutions such as mortgage companies and banks. The only loans
in these privately issued securities are mortgages either issued or guaranteed by Federal Housing Administration
and U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends a loan limitation of $550,000,000,000 and $54,000,000 for administrative expenses,
the same as the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.

Anti-lobbying prohibition.--The Committee recommendation includes a new bill-wide general provision prohibiting
certain communications to Congress by the entities funded by this Act.

Non-personnel services (NPS) spending.--The Committee directs GNMA to limit spending on NPS such as
conferences, training, and temporary service contracts to only that which is necessary to carry out mission critical
activities.

Quarterly reports.--The Committee directs GNMA to continue providing quarterly reports on the status of all non-
personnel expenses as outlined in the joint explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 118-42. In addition, GNMA is
directed to expand these reports to include the status of personnel compensation and benefits costs, as well as
staffing levels by office. The reports should compare planned or projected estimates to actuals to date.

                                                                                              Page 8 of 15

Policy Development and Research

RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024... $139,000,000

Budget request, fiscal year 2025... -36,500,000

Title V of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, as amended, directs the Secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to undertake programs of research, evaluation, and reports relating to the
Department's mission and programs. These functions are carried out internally and through grants and contracts
with industry, nonprofit research organizations, educational institutions, and through agreements with state and
local governments, and other Federal agencies. The research programs seek ways to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of HUD programs and to identify methods to achieve cost reductions. This appropriation is used to
support HUD evaluation and monitoring activities and to conduct housing surveys. Finally, funds under this heading
are used to support technical assistance activities to the various states, communities, and agencies that are
charged with administering HUD's programs and funds.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $119,000,000 for this account. Funding is provided in the amounts shown in the
following table:

[View table in the link at bottom.]

Core research and technology.--The recommendation provides not less than $70,000,000 for the core research
programs, including market surveys, research support and dissemination, data acquisition, housing finance studies,
research partnerships, and housing technology, of which $5,000,000 is for cooperative agreements and research
partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving
Institutions, and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions. Additionally, the Committee directs HUD to
use up to $3,500,000 to research innovative technologies in housing and disaster relief. These include 3-D
construction printing, drones in construction and disaster relief, virtual and augmented reality in construction
design, artificial intelligence, and other novel approaches to reduce costs and increase efficiencies in HUD's
jurisdictions.

Fair Market Rents (FMRs).--The Committee is concerned about a lack of timely communication in changes to fair
market rents estimates (FMRs) suddenly in the budget cycle. In order to make the best decisions possible, the
Committee needs timely updates, when necessary. HUD, in consultation with the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), is directed to provide as close to real-time changes to FMR projections on an as-needed basis.

Higher education and community partnerships.--The Committee believes that investing in research partnerships
between HUD and anchor institutions will ensure that HUD has access to innovative research and technology
advances to best address modern housing problems. The Committee encourages HUD to competitively award a
cooperative agreement for institutions of higher education or nonprofit entities that train and support institutions of
higher education to conduct research or provide technical assistance on matters related to economic opportunity,
reducing homelessness, or stable homeownership. In addition, the Committee urges the Department to include
funding for its Office of University Partnerships in its fiscal year 2026 Congressional Budget Justification.

                                                                                              Page 9 of 15

                           Appropriations Bill, 2025 - Title II - HUD (Part 7 of 13)

Impacts of indoor mold.--Indoor mold exposure impacts individuals living in all types of housing. HUD is encouraged
to study the health effects of indoor mold using up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature. PD&R, in consultation with the
Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, is urged to share these findings with the relevant offices within
HUD and with stakeholders upon completion of this review.

Large languages models use cases.--The Committee is interested in the potential benefits large language models
(LLMs) could provide in streamlining day-to-day processes of HUD. Therefore, the Committee urges the
Department to research use cases for LLMs within HUD programs and develop best practices for using LLMs for
employees. HUD is directed to brief the Committee no later than one year after enactment of this Act on the status
of the research.

Promoting land use policies and affordable housing development.--The Committee remains concerned about the
lack of affordable housing supply. Therefore, the Committee urges HUD to consult with DOT and issue joint non-
binding guidance outlining best practices for land use policies to increase the supply of affordable and market-rate
housing near transportation hubs.

Puerto Rico in the American Housing Survey (AHS).--The Committee recognizes the need to produce additional
housing data for Puerto Rico to better address the acute housing needs of the territory. The Department is
encouraged to utilize any incremental funding, if needed, within the core research and technology account to
complete a study on the feasibility of including Puerto Rico in the American Housing Survey (AHS). HUD is urged to
report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than one year after enactment of this Act on
the estimated timeline and immediate and long-term needs for this evaluation.

Recovery housing.--The Committee recognizes the importance of providing stakeholders training and technical
assistance on evidenced-based approaches to recovery housing and substance use disorder treatment services, to
expand the quality and capacity of recovery housing across the country. Of the amounts provided for technical
assistance, up to $2,500,000 shall be used to provide technical assistance and research in recovery housing to
communities and stakeholders for developing evidence-based recovery housing programs.

Rent reporting for affordable housing residents.--The Committee recognizes that some affordable housing providers
do not provide credit bureaus with reports of timely rent payments, putting such renters at a disadvantage in terms
of building their credit scores and having the ability to secure mortgages to purchase their first homes or rent from
the private market. Accordingly, of the amounts provided for technical assistance, up to $750,000 shall be used to
support training, technical assistance, and technology to allow public housing agencies and other HUD-assisted
housing providers in diverse areas, including Native housing providers, to report positive rental payment data at no
charge to residents to help residents improve their credit history when the resident affirmatively opts to have that
information reported and it is reported in compliance with strong federal privacy and state protections.

Research, evaluations, and demonstrations.--The recommendation provides up to $7,000,000 for new and
continuing studies and demonstration evaluations. These include (1) research on rapidly increasing rents in lower-
population density, non-coastal states (including in the Rocky Mountain region) and proposing promising solutions;
(2) the Community Choice demonstration; (3) state and local public financing models to produce affordable housing;
(4) assessing disaster and natural hazard risk in tribal communities; (5) HUD-assisted households and workforce
development programs; (6) rent reasonableness comparison in PHAs; and (7) Moving to Work (MTW) expansion.

Technical assistance.--The recommendation includes up to $42,000,000 for technical assistance. The Committee
remains supportive of the implementation of the Violence Against Women Act and encourages HUD to use funds
from the technical assistance account as necessary to assist with implementation.

and for providing technical support for enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and the civil rights statutes. OFHEO
serves as the central point for the formulation, clearance and dissemination of policies, intra-departmental
clearances, and public information related to fair housing issues. OFHEO receives, investigates, conciliates, and
recommends the issuance of charges of discrimination and determinations of non-compliance for complaints filed

Communications services for Limited English Proficient (LEP) communities.--The Committee is supportive of efforts
the Department is taking to improve communications and access to resources in different languages. In order to
achieve this, HUD needs to have appropriate and consistent translations for press releases, external
communication materials (including through digital, television, and radio advertising, as needed), and websites to
reach Limited English Proficient (LEP) communities. However, to improve implementation, the Committee
encourages the Department to adopt best practices and implement an enterprise-level solution to ensure uniform
translations across various Departmental platforms and standardize protocols for the creation and release of
translated materials.

lead-related and healthy homes issues, the office designs and administers programs for grants, training, research,
demonstration, and education.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

The Committee recommends $335,000,000 for the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. It does not
recommend the grant structural changes outlined in the budget request. Funding is provided in the amounts shown
in the following table:

[View table in the link at bottom.]

Asbestos in housing.--The Committee recognizes the potential impacts of building materials which contain asbestos
on an individual's health and safety. The Secretary of HUD is encouraged to engage regularly with the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of the Department of HHS to discuss
potential strategies to mitigate the harms of building materials in homes that contain asbestos.

Housing with multiple hazards.--Often, homes with lead- based paint or other hazards have more than one. The
compounding impact of these hazards can have detrimental impacts, especially on children. The Committee
encourages the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes to give homes with multiple hazards priority
consideration.

Improving the lead grant application process.--In line with the directive in P.L. 118-42, the Committee directs HUD
to continue to conduct outreach and improve its NOFOs to encourage more grantees to apply, especially those that
may not have access to professional grant writers, such as smaller and more rural communities. Additionally, HUD
shall continue to clearly state in its NOFOs that an application may include nonprofit co-applicants, provided that an
eligible city, county/parish, other unit of local government, or eligible State or Tribe are identified as the lead or co-
applicant. Non-profit co- applicants may include community development financial institutions that are positioned to
accelerate the pace at which low-income homeowners and rental property owners can address lead paint hazards
in high-risk communities.

New financing mechanism pilot.--The Committee is aware of the need for new financing mechanisms to address
lead and other residential environmental stressors in low-income communities with older housing stock. The
Committee provides $10,000,000 for the Department to establish a national financing pilot within the Healthy
Homes Program, so that these communities can access a range of financial products and increase the pace of
eliminating home-based hazards. HUD should collaborate with one or more financial institutions that serve low-
income communities, and coordinate with the Department of the Treasury to leverage HUD's lending capabilities.
The Committee requests a report on the progress of this pilot within 180 days of enactment of this Act.

services related to cyber security.

Officer (OCIO) and Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) toward specific IT oversight objectives,

efficiency of systems which serve employees' day to day human resources needs. The Committee encourages
