Body

Information Services Group ( ISG ) (Nasdaq: III ), a leading global technology research and advisory firm, has
launched a research study evaluating providers of managed network services, including those that integrate AI and
automation to manage increasingly complex networks.

The study results will be published in a comprehensive series of ISG Provider Lens(TM) reports, called Managed
Network Services 2024, scheduled to be released in December. Three regional reports will evaluate services
including wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), direct internet access (DIA), voice over internet
protocol (VoIP) and virtual private networks (VPNs), together with the provisioning of network-as-a-service (NaaS)
offerings.

Enterprise buyers will be able to use information from the reports to evaluate their current vendor relationships,
potential new engagements and available offerings, while ISG advisors use the information to recommend providers
to the firm's buy-side clients.

Enterprises are seeking support from managed network services (MNS) providers to take over their existing
network operations while transforming them into strong, flexible and advanced enterprise infrastructures. Advances
in network function virtualization (NFV) and AI-based technologies and the widespread use of diverse mobile,
branch and edge devices are further boosting the growth of the MNS market, ISG says.

"Experienced managed network services providers are using AI-based solutions and automation tools to enhance
network monitoring, troubleshooting and optimization," said Heiko Henkes, managing director of ISG Provider Lens
Research. "They, along with network operators, also offer advanced networks through as-a-service models,
allowing enterprises to consume capacity as needed in a highly flexible manner."

For the study, ISG has distributed surveys to nearly 130 providers of managed network services. Working in
collaboration with ISG's global advisors, the research team will produce three quadrants representing the services
and solutions the typical enterprise is buying based on ISG's experience working with its clients. The three
quadrants are:

                                                                                               Page 2 of 3

    •   Managed Network Services, evaluating providers helping enterprises evaluate, plan, upgrade and
        provision network services, including multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)/IP WAN or LAN services, fully
        managed WLAN and branch installations, edge points of presence (PoPs), managed firewalls and security.
        Services include setting up, replacing or upgrading installations; managing and monitoring remote
        operations, and undertaking fault diagnosis, configuration management, update and patch management
        and disaster recovery.
    •   Managed DIA, VPN and VoIP Services, covering service providers that offer fully managed DIA, VPN and
        VoIP services, either bundled or as individual offerings. DIA offers dedicated links to internet service
        providers to ensure high-quality and reliable connectivity; VoIP, when paired with high-speed broadband
        and 5G networks, offers more stable connections for calls and high-quality video conferences, and VPN
        offers secure and efficient connectivity for enterprises and their remote workforces.
    •   Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) Offerings, examining providers of NaaS, which combines flexible cloud
        computing with modern security models such as zero trust network access (ZTNA) to deliver advanced
        network and security solutions to enterprises. NaaS allows on-demand provisioning through a pay-as-you-
        go model, effectively meeting the evolving demands of SaaS and various cloud platforms, including edge
        computing.

Geographically focused reports from the study will cover the global managed network services market and examine
offerings available in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific (which for this report covers Australia, New Zealand,
Southeast Asia and India). ISG analysts Kenn Walters (U.S. and Europe) and Yash Jethani (Asia Pacific) will serve
as authors of the reports.

A list of identified providers and vendors and further details on the study are available in this digital brochure .
Companies not listed as managed services providers can contact ISG and ask to be included in the study.

All 2024 ISG Provider Lens(TM) evaluations feature expanded customer experience (CX) data that measures
actual enterprise experience with specific provider services and solutions, based on ISG's continuous CX research.
Enterprise customers wishing to share their experience about a specific provider or vendor are encouraged to

feedback.
