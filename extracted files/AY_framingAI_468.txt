        (CNN) - Tokyo's government is launching its own dating app as Japan's fertility rate plunges to a record
low. The nation of nearly 124 million people only recorded around 727,000 births last year, new data shows.

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.

1. Presidential race

President Joe Biden is set to present a case for democracy today in a speech at Pointe du Hoc, a clifftop in
Normandy, France, stormed by US Army Rangers on D-Day. It is the same spot where Ronald Reagan delivered a
speech 40 years ago and issued warnings against isolationism in the face of tyranny. Analysts say Biden will imply
that former President Donald Trump - with his "America First" foreign policy, attacks on the integrity of the free and
fair 2020 election and use of extreme anti-immigrant rhetoric that echoes that of the Nazis - is summoning the same
forces that triggered a global war. Meanwhile, Trump is back on the campaign trail after a guilty verdict was
delivered in his criminal hush money case. Trump on Thursday said he will announce his 2024 running mate at the
Republican convention next month.

2. Hunter Biden

President Biden said in an interview Thursday he would not pardon his son, Hunter Biden, if he's found guilty of
criminal federal gun charges. He also affirmed he would accept the outcome of the trial, currently underway in
Delaware. The president's son is accused of illegally purchasing the gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs,
a violation of federal law. Hallie Biden - the widow of Hunter Biden's late brother, Beau - testified Thursday about
her romantic relationship with Hunter, the couple's drug use and finding the gun at the center of the case. Once she
left the stand, a trio of witnesses testified about the series of events that led police to recover the ditched weapon.

3. Extreme heat

Heat advisories are in effect for more than 25 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico
as temperatures soar across parts of the US. Driving this prolonged, unseasonable heat is a robust heat dome - a

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3

large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or
weeks. Several temperature records were broken Thursday across states including California, Arizona and Nevada.
Las Vegas reached 111 degrees, topping the record of 110 degrees set in 2010. In California, a high of 122
degrees in Death Valley broke a record set in 1996. Phoenix also set a record high of 113 degrees, with more triple-
digit temperatures expected today.

4. Ukraine

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky drew parallels between World War II and his country's battle against
Russia in an address to French lawmakers today. "Hitler crossed red line after red line, Putin does the same," he
said, adding that Ukrainians were the heirs of the Allied fighters of World War II. Zelensky's speech was greeted
rapturously by the French National Assembly, with lawmakers giving him a standing ovation. His remarks came just
hours after Russia attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure overnight, targeting at least nine regions including the
capital Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said. For months, Russia has targeted Ukraine's power grid to deprive its citizens
of electricity, heat, water and other essential services.

5. Cargo ships

An "out of control" cargo ship prompted the temporary closure of a major bridge in Charleston, South Carolina, this
week. An investigation is underway to determine what caused a crew to lose control of the ship on Wednesday near
the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. The incident came over two months after the massive Dali cargo ship lost power and
crashed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, destroying the 1.6-mile span and killing six construction workers.
The Port of Baltimore shipping channel could fully reopen this weekend after painstaking operations to remove
debris, officials said. The disaster spurred increased scrutiny of bridges across the US that could be at risk of
collapse as infrastructure ages and cargo ships grow in size.
