Management Commentary

"In 2023, we achieved significant milestones by initiating and delivering rapid organic growth at our existing sites,
prioritizing debt repayment, and fortifying liquidity. We look forward to sharing comprehensive details of our fourth
quarter and full-year 2023 results, as well as our outlook for 2024, later this month," said Paul Prager, Chief
Executive Officer of TeraWulf.

“The critical significance of infrastructure scalability at our current sites cannot be overstated. It's the backbone of
our strategy, providing stability, control, and substantial long-term cost advantages. This strategic asset empowers
us to optimize efficiency, scale operations opportunistically, and ultimately drive profitability. As we continue to
invest in and expand our infrastructure, I firmly believe we're cementing our position as a leader in the industry,”
added Prager.

Patrick Fleury, Chief Financial Officer, emphasized, "Our proactive debt reduction, dedication to financial
transparency, and rapid, organic infrastructure growth coupled with our leading unit economics underscores the
Company’s commitment to lead in this space – now and beyond the halving.”

2024 Financial Guidance

TeraWulf's 2024 outlook reflects the Company's commitment to achieving industry-leading unit economics,
proactively reducing debt, and strategically investing in organic growth to further expand digital infrastructure
capacity at its existing sites.

Any guidance that we provide is subject to change as a variety of factors can affect actual operating results. Certain
factors that may impact our actual operating results are identified below in the safe harbor language included within
Forward-Looking Statements of this press release.

Profitability

The Company estimates that its total production cost, or cost-to-mine a bitcoin, ranks among the lowest among
publicly listed bitcoin mining companies at approximately $25,000 per BTC pre-halving and assuming the illustrative
market inputs outlined in the table below. Post the upcoming halving, which is projected to occur in April 2024,
TeraWulf’s estimated production cost per BTC is expected to be approximately $37,000.

The following financial guidance reflects the Company’s expectations for the fiscal year 2024 and is provided on a
non-GAAP basis.

Organic Growth

As previously announced, operational capacity at the Lake Mariner facility has now reached 160 MW, accompanied
by a hash rate of 8.0 EH/s entering March. Construction of Building 4 at the Lake Mariner facility is proceeding as
planned, substantially funded, and is on track for completion by mid-2024. This additional infrastructure is
anticipated to add an incremental 35 MW of capacity, thereby increasing TeraWulf’s operational mining capacity to
approximately 10 EH/s.

With significant room for expansion at its existing sites, the Company reiterates its commitment to achieving 300
MW of infrastructure capacity in operation by the close of 2024, and reaching 550 MW, or approximately 28.3 EH/s
with current generation of miners, of deployed infrastructure in 2025. The Company continues to evaluate the
highest return use for its energy infrastructure, including the potential application of HPC/AI.

Debt Repayment and Liquidity

Following significant debt repayments totaling $21.4 million related to 2023 quarterly excess cash flow sweep
payments and an $18.6 million voluntary prepayment in February 2024, TeraWulf's total debt balance was
approximately $106.0 million as of the end of February. The Company anticipates an additional repayment of
approximately $30.0 million during the first week of April, thereby reducing the debt balance to $76.0 million.

After the expected April debt repayment, and based on current bitcoin price levels, the Company anticipates having
approximately $20.0 million in excess liquidity to navigate the upcoming halving. This projected cash reserve can be
allocated towards additional debt reduction, potentially lowering the debt balance to $56.0 million, excluding any
excess cash flow sweep payments for in Q2-Q4 2024.

Note About Preliminary Unaudited Financial Highlights

The preliminary financial results presented above are the responsibility of management and have been prepared in
good faith on a consistent basis with prior periods. However, we have not completed our financial closing
procedures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and our actual results could be materially
different from these preliminary financial results. In addition, RSM US LLP, our independent registered public
accounting firm, has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to these
preliminary financial results and does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to these
preliminary financial results or their achievability. During the course of the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, we may identify items that would
require us to make material adjustments to the preliminary financial results presented above. As a result,
prospective investors should exercise caution in relying on this information and should not draw any inferences from
this information regarding financial or operating data not provided. These preliminary financial results should not be
viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S . GAAP. In addition, these
preliminary financial results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved in any future period. For a
discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures and the rationales for using non-GAAP financial
measures, please reference the “Non-GAAP Measure” section in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our September 30, 2023 10Q filing with the SEC.

We have not provided reconciliations of preliminary and projected Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP
measure of net income/(loss) to common shareholders. Providing net income/(loss) to common shareholders
guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and
other non-core operating items that are included in net income/(loss) to common shareholders, including but not
limited to asset impairments and income tax valuation adjustments. Reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure with
the most comparable GAAP measure for historical periods is indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared
upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance. Please reference the “Non-GAAP financial
information” accompanying our quarterly earnings conference call presentations on our website at
www.terawulf.com/investors for our GAAP results and the reconciliations of these measures, where used, to the
comparable GAAP measures.

1 The Company’s share of the earnings or losses from operations at the Nautilus Cryptomine facility is reflected
within “Equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax” in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly,
operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of
operations lines in TeraWulf’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses these metrics as indictors
of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to
provide comparisons to peer companies. All figures except Bitcoin Self-Mined are estimates and remain subject to
standard month-end adjustments. 2 Includes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement
at the Lake Mariner facility and TeraWulf’s net share of bitcoin mined at the Nautilus Cryptomine facility, based on
hashrate share attributed to the Company.3 Computed as the weighted-average opening price of bitcoin on each
respective day the Bitcoin Self-Mined is earned.4 Excludes hashrate associated with 64 bitcoin earned from profit
sharing associated with a hosting agreement.5 While nameplate inventory for WULF’s two facilities is estimated at
5.5 EH/s as of December 31, 2023, the Company significantly expanded capacity at its Lake Mariner facility during
2023 (from 2.0 EH/s as of December 31, 2022). Further, actual monthly hash rate performance depends on a
variety of factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin,
scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to
participation in various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and
ASIC maintenance and repair.6 Assumes first full day of halving is April 21, 2024.7 Assumes 3% ancillary load.
