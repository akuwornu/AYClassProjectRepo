announced, on April 1, 2024 the Company entered into a definitive arrangement agreement to be taken private by
Advent International ("Advent"), one of the world's largest and most experienced global private equity investors, as
well as a longstanding sponsor in the payments space, alongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer,
certain investment funds managed by Novacap Management Inc. and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, in
an all-cash transaction which values the Company at an enterprise value of approximately $6.3 billion (the
"Proposed transaction"). Advent will acquire all the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and any
Multiple Voting Shares (collectively the "Shares") that are not Rollover Shares1, for a price of $34.00 per Share, in
cash. This price represents an attractive and significant premium of approximately 56% to the closing price of the
Subordinate Voting Shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") on March 15, 2024, the last trading day
prior to media reports concerning a potential transaction involving the Company, and a premium of approximately
48% to the 90-day volume weighted average trading price per Subordinate Voting Share as of such date.The
Proposed transaction will be implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business
Corporations Act. The Proposed transaction was approved by shareholders at a special meeting held on June 18,

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 5

2024 and received court approval on June 20, 2024. The proposed transaction remains subject to customary
closing conditions, including receipt of key regulatory approvals (a number of which were received and/or for which
the waiting period has expired as of the date hereof, with several approvals remaining outstanding), is not subject to
any financing condition and, assuming the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, is expected to
close in late 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.Following completion of the transaction, it is expected that the
Subordinate Voting Shares will be delisted from each of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq and that
Nuvei will cease to be a reporting issuer in all applicable Canadian jurisdictions and will deregister the Subordinate
Voting Shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").Cash DividendNuvei today
announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per Subordinate Voting
Share and Multiple Voting Share, payable on September 5, 2024 to shareholders of record on August 20, 2024.
The aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be approximately $14 million, to be funded from the
Company's existing cash on hand.The Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar
provincial or territorial legislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and any
future dividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to report such dividends as a dividend to
U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain
non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as "qualified dividend income" and therefore may be
taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A U.S. shareholder should talk to its advisor regarding such
dividends, including with respect to the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US).The
declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, as
more fully described under the heading "Forward-Looking Information" of this press release.Conference Call,
Financial Outlook and Growth TargetsIn light of the Proposed transaction, Nuvei no longer holds earnings
conference calls or provides its financial outlook or growth targets.About NuveiNuvei (Nasdaq: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI)

interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to the
preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the IASB.
The information presented in this press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios
and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per
basic share, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and Total volume.
These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by
IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these
measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding
of our results of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation
nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial statements reported under IFRS. These measures are
used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in Nuvei's
business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS and other financial
measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to facilitate operating performance
comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine
components of management compensation. We believe these measures are important additional measures of our
performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used widely among others in the payment
technology industry as a means of evaluating a company's underlying operating performance.Non-IFRS Financial
MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means to evaluate operating performance, by
eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss)
before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, acquisition,
integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency
exchange, and legal settlement and other.Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures:We use Adjusted EBITDA
less capital expenditures (which we define as acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a
supplementary indicator of our operating performance.Adjusted net income:We use Adjusted net income as an

                                                                                                           Page 3 of 5
                                   Nuvei Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results

indicator of business performance and profitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is
defined as net income (loss) before acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and
related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets,
and the related income tax expense or recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in
redemption value of liability-classified common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase
liability and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other.Non-IFRS Financial
RatiosAdjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share:We use Adjusted net income per basic share
and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a per share basis. Adjusted
net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less net income attributable to non-
controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period, respectively. The number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted average number of
common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is determined using the
treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS.Supplementary Financial MeasuresWe monitor the following key
performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our
business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our key performance indicators may be
calculated in a manner that differs from similar key performance indicators used by other companies.Total volume:
We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume and similar measures are
used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a company's performance. We define
Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in the period by customers under contractual
agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue earned by us. Total volume includes acquiring
volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, gateway/technology volume, where
we provide our gateway/technology services but are not in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, as
well as the total dollar value of transactions processed relating to APMs and payouts. Since our revenue is primarily
sales volume and transaction-based, generated from merchants' daily sales and through various fees for value-
added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will generally impact our revenue.Forward-
