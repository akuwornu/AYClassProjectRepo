The following is a summary of the funding allocation provided to each component of the account:

Office of the Clerk ... $44,984,000

The Committee recommends $44,984,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Clerk, an increase of
$3,529,000 from the fiscal year 2024 enacted total.

Congressionally Mandated Reports.--The Committee recognizes the value of making statute-required reports more
readily available and discoverable. The Committee requests that the Office of the Clerk, in consultation with the
Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office, and the Congressional Data Task Force, author a report
describing the challenges and opportunities associated with making these reports more readily available and
discoverable. The scope of the report shall include, but not be limited to (1) reports covered by Public Law 117-263
and listed in H. Doc. 118-4; (2) potential impacts, if enacted, of S. 2073, the Eliminate Useless Reports Act of 2023;
and (3) if it is feasible that submitted reports to Congress be delivered to House committees electronically via the
Clerk's Committee portal in concert with the Government Publishing Office's Congressionally Mandated Reports

                                                                                                      Page 5 of 13
    House Appropriations Committee Issues Report on Legislative Appropriations Bill, 2025 - Title I - Legislative
                                      Branch Appropriations (Part 2 of 5)

submission portal or GovInfo. The report shall be submitted to the House Committee on Appropriations and the
Committee on House Administration within 180 days of enactment of this Act.

Legislative Branch Data Map and Management Plan.--The Legislative branch is the creator and steward of
invaluable information in the form of data that is utilized by Congress, federal agencies, and the public to ensure
access to a historical record of legislative action. Each House Officer and the myriad of business units within them
play an essential role in the life cycle of legislative and operational data. However, one comprehensive data map
encompassing legislative documents, records of proceedings, administrative records, official communications,
metadata, and operational information related to human resources, disbursements, employment, and other
administrative functions, wholistically examining the lifecycle of this data across the House, does not exist. As such,
the Congressional Data Task Force is to take inventory of all current data maps that exist across the House Clerk,
Chief Administrative Office, and Sergeant at Arms, and produce a report that (1) details the current status of data
maps across the House, (2) identifies where data maps need to be developed and standardized, and (3) make
recommendations for the House on how the data maps can be completed and compiled into a single, unified House
data map that is maintained into the future. For purposes of this report, only data owned and managed by the
House Officers is expected to be included in the data inventory and considered for the recommendations. Any and
all data that remains in the ownership of individual Members and committees is considered beyond the scope of this
report. Additionally, any data that is owned by the House and then transferred to the Senate or a Legislative Branch
agency should be included in the data map but illustrate where those ownership transfers occur. The final report is
to be submitted to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on House Administration no later
than 120 days after enactment of this Act.

Office of the Sergeant at Arms ... $34,141,000

The Committee recommends $34,141,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms
(SAA). This amount is a decrease of $4,652,000 from the fiscal year 2024 enacted total as a result of the
nonrecurrence of certain lifecycle replacements in fiscal year 2024.

Incident Management Tools.--The Committee is aware that the House Sergeant at Arms is investigating emergency
communications technology in an effort to enhance the safety and security of Members, their families and staff both
on the Hill and in their districts. The SAA is directed to brief the Committee on those efforts within 90 days after
issuance of this report.

Cyber Security for Members of Congress.--The Committee commends the Sergeant at Arms for working with the
Chief Administrative Officer to expand the Residential Security Program to include certain cybersecurity and privacy
resources for Members of Congress to deter, prevent, mitigate, and remediate threats to their home networks and
the potential resulting impact of those threats on official House business and encourages the continuation of the
cybersecurity opportunity of the program.

Congressional Fellowships.--The Committee believes there should be more formalized guidance provided to
congressional offices regarding congressional fellowships. The Committee looks forward to the comprehensive set
of best practices governing the onboarding, training, and oversight of fellows serving in congressional offices as
directed in House Report 118-120.

District Office Security.--The Committee is in receipt of the District Office Security report as directed in House
Report 118-120 and looks forward to working with the Sergeant at Arms to ensure the protection of congressional
district office staff and the constituents served.

Gunshot Detection Systems.--The Committee commends the SAA and the United States Capitol Police (USCP) for
reviewing the operational need and feasibility of the use of gunshot detection technology on the grounds of the
Capitol complex. The Committee supports the partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and the
United States Secret Service (USSS) to determine the most operationally and financially beneficial platform. The
Committee looks forward to final evaluation and discussion of integration options to determine the best path
forward. The SAA is directed to brief the Committee on the progress within 60 days of enactment of this Act.

                                                                                                      Page 6 of 13

                                      Branch Appropriations (Part 2 of 5)

Firearm Detection Software.--The Committee encourages the SAA to work with the USCP to investigate whether a
patented firearm detection software would complement the existing security infrastructure throughout the United
States Capitol complex as well as district offices as a part of a broader security enhancement option. The software
must be developed in the United States, without the use of any third party or open- source data. The Committee
looks forward to a recommendation upon completion of the review 90 days after enactment of this Act.

Office of the Chief Administrative Officer ... $213,072,000

The Committee recommends $213,072,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Chief Administrative
Officer (CAO), the same as the fiscal year 2024 enacted total.

Office of Talent and Development.--In fiscal year 2024, the Committee supported the CAO in its undertaking to
reorganize and streamline internal functions of the House to include (1) creating the Office of Talent and
Development; (2) expanding the capacity and ability to promote best practices, tips, and tools available on the
House Human Resources Hub; and (3) finding additional efficiencies by eliminating overlap and duplication of
programs and service offerings into one central organization. The Committee directs the CAO to issue a report
within 90 days of the issuance of this report on the progress and impacts of these efforts.

Access to Childcare.--The House Child Care Center completed its expansion in 2020, but pandemic restrictions
required the extra space to be utilized for the reduction in capacity per square feet, allowing the Center to maintain
its enrollment size, but not alleviate the three-year waiting list for entry. The CAO is encouraged to continue to
expedite the hiring of the faculty necessary to fully utilize the House Child Care Center expansion to reduce the
waitlist and maximize this benefit.

Artificial Intelligence Working Group.--The Committee acknowledges the efforts of the CAO's artificial
intelligence (AI) working group to investigate how emerging AI tools could improve the efficiency of House
operations. The Committee reminds the CAO of the directive in House Report 118-120, to provide monthly progress
briefings to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on House Administration on its work and
looks forward to the report examining the near- and mid-term opportunities for generative AI tools, as well as
strategies to mitigate new risks.

Allergy Safety in House Dining Facilities.--The Committee underscores the importance of providing an accessible
workplace for those with food allergies and awaits the report directed in House Report 118-120 from the CAO on
steps taken by food service providers operating within the House of Representatives to accommodate those with
food allergies.

International Travel with House Devices.--The Committee recognizes the inherent security risks of taking House
devices abroad and notes the House Security Office recommendation that Members and staff use dedicated travel
devices when traveling internationally. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the report ordered in House
Report 118-120, to identify what additional actions offices can take to keep devices and the House network secure
when traveling.

Flag Procurement.--The Committee acknowledges the Chief Administrative Officer's commitment to support
Americans with disabilities in the spirit and intent of the Javits-Wagner- O'Day Act by offering a wide complement of
AbilityOne products in the House Supply Store. The Committee encourages the CAO to continue to explore
additional marketing opportunities for AbilityOne products and directs the CAO to investigate any potential cost
savings opportunities through the procurement of flags through AbilityOne for the Capitol Flag Program and report
its findings to the Committee within 120 days of the issuance of this report.

Casework Assistance for Member Offices.--The Committee commends the ongoing efforts by the Chief
Administrative Officer to assist Member offices with casework through programs such as the CAO Coach Program
for caseworkers, district office conferences, the Agency Connection Center, and the project to anonymize and
aggregate constituent casework data. The CAO is directed to further examine what additional assistance could be
provided to Member offices to more effectively assist constituents with casework and provide a report detailing what

                                                                                                      Page 7 of 13

additional efforts could be provided and the resources necessary to support such efforts within 60 days of
enactment of this Act to the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on House Administration.

Capitol Switchboard Modernization.--The Committee recognizes the vital role the Capitol Telephone Exchange
plays in ensuring constituents have the ability to contact their Representative or Senator. The Committee is
interested to understand what opportunities may be available to modernize the current system and directs the CAO
to track how the typical constituent is routed to a House office, when the peak call times occur, how often the
automated system is utilized, and any other pertinent information that could be used to determine how to maximize
the efficiency of the system. The CAO shall report to the Committee on its findings 90 days after enactment of this
Act.

Office of the Whistleblower Ombuds ... $1,250,000

Office of the Inspector General ... 5,772,000

Office of General Counsel ... 2,048,000

Office of the Parliamentarian ... 2,287,000

Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House ... 5,048,000

Office of the Legislative Counsel of the House ... 15,300,000

Legislative Counsel Member Portal.--The House Office of Legislative Counsel (HOLC) provides legislative drafting
services on a non-partisan, impartial, and confidential basis. The Committee acknowledges the essential role and
services provided by HOLC in support of the House's legislative and constitutional responsibilities and recognizes
the significant and growing workload by Members and committees in fully meeting legislative drafting needs. The
Committee directs HOLC to work with the Chief Administrative Officer and any other relevant House offices to
conduct a feasibility study on the creation of a secure portal, that maintains attorney-client privileges, which would
allow House offices the ability to monitor the status of requested bill text and the attorney assigned to each draft.
The Committee directs HOLC to report on the feasibility and the resources necessary to create and maintain such a
portal within 120 days of the issuance of this report.

Office of Interparliamentary Affairs ... $994,000 Other authorized employees ... $1,065,000

Green and Gold Congressional Aide Program ... 3,356,000

Green and Gold Congressional Aide Program.--The Green and Gold program was established to create long-term
employment opportunities for veterans and families of our fallen within the House of Representatives. The
Committee recommendation provides the fiscal year 2025 requested amount of $3,356,000. Despite the record high
average salary ensuring these employment opportunities are competitive, the program has experienced a steep
decline in applications. The Committee encourages the Chief Administrative Officer to work with the Committee on
House Administration to broaden the pool of potential applicants through programmatic changes, such as allowing
active-duty spouses to be incorporated into the program and allowing Members to request extensions for
participants.

Office of Congressional Ethics ... $1,810,000

Change from request ... 0

The Modernization Initiatives Account continues to be funded at the level of $10,000,000 to help implement the
recommendations of the Modernization Subcommittee, which was created within the Committee on House
Administration to continue the work of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. The Committee
believes that investing in these recommendations will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the House of
Representatives so that it can better serve the American people.

Some of the recommendations implemented utilizing this funding include e-Discovery software for House
Committee digital investigations, an anonymized constituent data pilot, real time payroll information, a committee
portal to streamline committee work, and a study on collaborative legislative drafting tools. The Committee looks
forward to receiving and evaluating recommendations currently under review by the Modernization Subcommittee
such as: better Congress.gov accounting for Member contributions, co-sponsorship gathering tools, visual display
enhancements for hearings and events, the constituent tour management tool, and additional collaborative staff
space in the House Office Buildings.

The Committee supports efforts by the Committee on House Administration to expand Member professional
development opportunities and provide additional resources for new members as they navigate the first year of
legislative responsibilities.

Congressional Staff Directory.--Modern data software provides opportunities for the legislative branch to
significantly improve access to identity data while preserving important security rules concerning this sensitive
information. Following the report requested in House Report 117-389 and in support of the recommendation by the
Subcommittee on Modernization to establish a shared staff directory to enhance the exchange of information and
improve collaboration, the Committee authorized funds to develop a prototype as a proof of concept for a

                                                                                                      Page 9 of 13

Congressional Staff Directory. The Committee continues to encourage other Legislative Branch entity participation
and directs the CAO to keep the Committee apprised of this effort.

Capitol Flag Program.--The Capitol Flag Program allows Members of Congress to request a flag to be flown over
the U.S. Capitol on behalf of their constituents. Each flag is issued a keepsake Certificate of Authenticity with the
option to personalize it. The number of requests and the popularity of the Capitol Flag Program grows steadily each
year, necessitating the continuous modernization of how orders are fulfilled. In fiscal year 2024, the Committee
provided funding to the CAO to develop a flag tracking system to provide constituents the ability to track flags from
order to receipt. The Committee commends the CAO for the launch of a flag tracking pilot program and encourages
the expansion of the pilot to more House offices.

account to be used for deficit or debt reduction.

The Committee recommends $14,450,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT),
providing an increase of $896,000 above fiscal year 2024.

The JCT operates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and its predecessors dating to the Revenue Act of
1926. It has responsibility to (1) investigate the operation and effects of internal revenue taxes and the
administration of such taxes, (2) investigate measures and methods for the simplification of such taxes, (3) make
reports to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance (or to the House of
Representatives and the Senate) on the results of such investigations and studies and to make recommendations,
and (4) review any proposed refund or credit of income or estate and gift taxes or certain other taxes set forth in
U.S. Code section 6405 in excess of $2,000,000 ($5,000,000 in the case of a C corporation). In addition to these
functions that are specified in the Internal Revenue Code, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the JCT
to provide revenue estimates for all tax legislation considered by either the House or the Senate.

                                      Branch Appropriations (Part 2 of 5)

Change from enacted level ... +30,630,000

Change from request. ... -17,289,000

The Committee recommends $619,257,000 for the personnel salaries, benefits, student loan repayment, and
overtime requirements, to include the cost of overtime necessary for providing training of the U.S. Capitol Police
(USCP). The recommendation provides full funding for 2,126 sworn officers, as requested, in fiscal year 2025.

Concept of Operations Plan.--In the joint explanatory statement accompanying the Legislative Branch
Appropriations Act, 2023, the Committee directed the Department to provide a guide for future operations based on
an in-depth, Department- wide assessment. As part of the Department's evaluation of the report, three foundational
program areas were identified as the first step toward implementation of the recommendations provided in the
report: Establish a Workforce Management/ Staffing Office to optimize utilization of human resources; Conduct an
organization-wide training gap assessment; and Conduct a comprehensive Technology Analysis and Future Needs
Assessment. The Committee provides $1,657,000 for the personnel required to build an implementation
infrastructure to support future recommendation realization.

Civilian Staffing.--While the Committee supports the Department's authorized number of civilians, the Committee's
recommendation includes a reduction to the request as the Department's projections for fiscal year 2024 civilian
hiring are below the authorized and appropriated levels. The Committee believes it will be difficult to hire the
requested civilians for fiscal year 2025.

Motorized Devices.--As noted in House Report 117-389, the Committee expects the Capitol Police to continue its
outreach efforts to dockless scooter and bicycle companies and the District of Columbia, and to work to better
educate users, including congressional staff, District residents and visitors, on the appropriate operation of dockless
scooters and bicycles on Capitol Grounds.

Risk-Based Protections for Members of Congress.--The Committee continues to expect the U.S. Capitol Police
Chief to continue working closely with the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms and local law enforcement
partners on the USCP strategy for Members' protection within the NCR while outside the Capitol Grounds, and to
educate Member offices on this topic. The Committee instructs the U.S. Capitol Police Chief to coordinate with the
House and Senate Sergeants at Arms to direct patrols to buildings or locations where the Members tend to
congregate in order to fulfill its mission under 2 U.S.C. 1966.

Use of Grounds.--As instructed in House Report 117-389, the USCP should continue to forebear enforcement of 2
U.S.C. 1963 and the Traffic Regulations for the United States Capitol Grounds when encountering snow sledders
on the grounds.

USCP Office of Inspector General.--The Committee includes no less than $850,000 and supports no fewer than 15
FTE within the USCP Office of Inspector General (OIG). The Committee appreciates the diligent work that the OIG
has done with the increased workload due to Committee and Board project requests. As the Department's budget
increases, the complexities of the financial statement audit have necessitated its outsourcing so that the OIG may
continue to fulfill its statutory responsibilities for auditing Department programs and operations to ensure efficacy
and investigation of complaints for potential fraud, waste, or abuse.

General Expenses

Appropriation, fiscal year 2024 ... $202,846,000

                                      Branch Appropriations (Part 2 of 5)

Change from request. ... -50,686,000

The Committee recommends $213,158,000 for general expenses to support the responsibilities for law
enforcement, Capitol complex physical and technological security, dignitary protection, intelligence analysis, event
management, hazardous material/devices, IT, and other specialized responses, as well as logistical and
administrative support. Of the total, $5,848,000 shall remain available until September 30, 2029, to support
Congressional Continuity of Operations (C-COOP) initiatives.

General Expenses for Fiscal Year 2025.--The Committee supports resourcing the Department to meet its essential
needs and that the Department can fulfill its mission with a minimal increase of funding for general expenses. The
Capitol Police's budget has seen a significant increase in recent years, which has been widely supported, but the
Committee acknowledges that full execution of funding has been a challenge. The recommendation should not be
taken as a lack of support for the Capitol Police or its mission, but rather in line with a requirement for prudent fiscal
decisions.

Concept of Operations Plan.--In the joint explanatory statement accompanying the Legislative Branch
Appropriations Act, 2023, the Committee directed the Department to provide a guide for future operations based on
an in-depth, Department- wide assessment. As part of the Department's evaluation of the report, three foundational
program areas were identified as the first step toward implementation of the recommendations provided in the
report: Establish a Workforce Management/ Staffing Office to optimize utilization of human resources; Conduct an
organization-wide training gap assessment; and Conduct a comprehensive Technology Analysis and Future Needs
Assessment. The Committee provides $745,000 to build an implementation infrastructure to support future
recommendation realization.

Congressional Continuity of Operations Plan.--The Department's fiscal year 2025 budget included a $49,400,000
funding request to support the C-COOP. The Committee believes this is a priority as part of the Department's core
mission and therefore supports the Department having an independent, in- house response and deployment
capability to allow it to respond to changing environments, and, ultimately, to protect Members of Congress and
recommends $5,848,000 to build IT capabilities to establish connectivity and radio communication capabilities,
research development and training, as well as physical security requirements including deployable screening
equipment, mobile vehicle barriers, mobile kiosks, and deployable barriers.

USCP Office of the Inspector General Report Disclosure.--In response to previous House Reports 117-80 and 117-
389, the Committee is encouraged that the Office of the Inspector General has begun making its reports publicly
available whenever practicable and has started publishing reports on its website. The Committee is supportive of
the process initiated by the Office of the Inspector General to gain approval for the public posting of its reports and
directs the Capitol Police Board to further these efforts to expedite the process.

Wellness Programs for Law Enforcement.--The Committee appreciates the efforts undertaken by the USCP to
develop and implement a holistic wellness and resiliency program for its workforce, including the Howard C. `Howie'
Liebengood Center for Wellness. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report directed in House Report
118-120 to gain insights into the wellness program and its accessibility to the USCP workforce.
