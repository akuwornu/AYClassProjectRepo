Saskatoon, SK., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Draganfly Inc. (NASDAQ: DPRO) (CSE: DPRO) (FSE:
3U8) (“Draganfly” or the “Company”), an award-winning, industry-leading drone solutions and systems developer, is
pleased to announce its fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter and the year
was dictated by the shift to larger in-house capacity and drone production capabilities.

The financial year 2023 was a transition year for Draganfly as 2023 marked new production capacity coming online
along with the commercialization of its flagship Commander 3XL and Heavy Lift Drone platforms.

Key Financial Highlights for 2023:
    •     Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $6,554,842. Product sales decreased $263,339
          in 2023 as compared to 2022, while services revenue decreased $786,878. This is largely due to product
          line transition and a focus on building new and increased production capabilities
    •     Gross Profit was $2,064,114, an increase of $1,273,439 or up 161.1% from the prior year. As a percentage
          of sales, gross margin increased from 10.4% in 2022 to 31.5% in 2023. This year’s gross profit included a
          one-time non-cash write-down of inventory of $331,671 while last year’s gross profit included a non-cash
          downward adjustment of $1,976,514. Excluding these adjustments, gross profit decreased by $371,404
          year over year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted gross margin increased from 36.4% in 2022 to 36.5% in
          2023.
    •     The Company recorded a comprehensive loss including all non-cash items of $23,709,851 compared to a
          comprehensive loss of $27,305,305 in 2022. The comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31,
          2023, includes non-cash changes comprised of a gain in fair value of derivative liability from warrants of
          $211,110, an expense for impairment of notes receivable of $101,351, a write-down of inventory of
          $331,671, and an expense for goodwill and intangibles impairment of $87,415 and would otherwise have
          been a comprehensive loss of $23,400,524 compared to a comprehensive loss of $24,067,180 excluding

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 6

        non-cash items in the same period last year. Cash used in operating activities decreased by $1,304,184
        year over year.
   •    The Company’s cash balance on December 31, 2023, was $3,093,612.

Key Financial and Operational Highlights for Q4 2023 and Early 2024:
   •    Revenue for Q4 2023 was $916,299 compared to $1,314,162 for Q4 2022 largely due to a decrease in Q4
        product sales relating to product line transition and new customer category integration requirements along
        with slightly lower services sales.
   •    Gross Profit was $258,879 for Q4 2023 compared to -$1,665,971 in Q4 2022 representing an increase of
        $1,924,850 year over year. Gross profit for Q4 2023 would have been $382,303 if it wasn’t for a one time
        non-cash write down of inventory of $123,424 while Q4 2022 would have been $310,543 not including a
        one-time non-cash write down of inventory for $1,976,514. Hence, gross profit on an adjusted basis was up
        23.1% year over year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for Q4 2023 was 28.3% but on an adjusted
        basis was 41.7%.
   •    The Company recorded a comprehensive loss including non-cash items for Q4 2023 of $4,191,796
        compared to a comprehensive loss of $16,660,602 for the same period in 2022. A 69.3% improvement
        over 2022. The comprehensive loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes non-cash changes comprised of
        a gain in fair value derivative liability of $153,798 as well as a one time write down of inventory of
        $123,424, and would otherwise be a comprehensive loss of $4,222,170 compared to a comprehensive loss
        of $7,482,545 excluding non-cash items in the same period last year. The decrease in loss was primarily
        due to lower professional fees, wages, and share based compensation charges.
   •    The Company received a Transport Canada Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC) for its Heavy Lift
        Drone to support advanced flight testing above 55lbs/25KG MTOW. This will allow the highly specialized
        development of advanced delivery, industrial, and defense applications. The Heavy Lift Flight Testing
        SFOC allows Draganfly to conduct these specialized and advanced operations utilizing the Heavy Lift
        within an approved flight test area. This development also enables the Company to initiate direct
        application and use-case testing. Draganfly can enhance and optimize highly specialized operational and
        maintenance manuals and Standard Operating Procedures for various conditions and scenarios.
   •    The Company addressed United Nations Experts speaking on emerging technologies for disaster risk
        reduction organized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International
        Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)
        as part of ITU’s webinar series on digital transformation. It focused on the transformative ability of cutting-
        edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial
        Vehicles (UAVs), digital twin, and the Metaverse and their use in disaster management. This event
        explored how these technological innovations can effectively mitigate and respond to natural hazards and
        disasters.
   •    The Company showcased the Commander 3XL and new military special-purpose capabilities at Modern
        Warfare Week in Fayetteville, NC. The event is a premier gathering for the Special Operations Forces
        (SOF) community, providing a platform for education and collaboration on the evolving landscape of
        warfare. 800 select military and government representatives are anticipated to attend. The Global Special
        Operations Foundation (GSOF) and the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC)
        jointly sponsor the event.
   •    Draganfly announced the closing of a US$3.5 million underwritten offering, with the Company planning to
        allocate the net proceeds towards general corporate purposes. These purposes included funding its
        capabilities to meet the demand for its new products, supporting growth initiatives, covering working capital
        requirements, continuing the development and marketing of the Company's core product, potential
        acquisitions, and research and development efforts.
   •    Draganfly announced record third-quarter results for 2023, recording revenue of $2,138,017, which marked
        a 14.0% increase from the same period the previous year. The revenue for Q3 of 2023 comprised product

        $516,235 from drone services, highlighting the Company's growth and expansion in its market segments.

at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The Company was allowed an initial 180-day grace
period, or until March 20, 2024, (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with the Rule. To regain
compliance with the Rule the closing bid price of the Company’s common shares needed to be at least $1.00 per
share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period.

On March 21, 2024, the Company received notification that it had failed to regain compliance with the Rule and is
not eligible for a second 180 day compliance period because of its failure to comply with the $5 million minimum
stockholders’ equity initial listing requirement for the period ended September 30, 2023. Unless the Company timely
requests a hearing before an independent Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities will be
subject to delisting. Accordingly, the Company will request a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will
automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional
extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules,
the Panel has the discretion to grant an additional extension period that can expire as late as September 17, 2024.
At the hearing, the Company will be asked to provide a plan to regain compliance to the Panel. The Company

                                                                                                           Page 5 of 6

intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the Rule and request the continued listing of its common shares
on Nasdaq pending such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s
request or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing
on Nasdaq.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

In this press release, we describe certain income and expense items that are unusual or non-recurring. There are
terms not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Our usage of these terms may vary from
the usage adopted by other companies. Specifically, gross profit and gross margin are undefined terms by IFRS
that may be referenced herein. We provide this detail so that readers have a better understanding of the significant
events and transactions that have had an impact on our results.

Throughout this release, reference is made to “gross profit,” and “gross margin,” which are non-IFRS measures.
Management believes that gross profit, defined as revenue less operating expenses, is a useful supplemental
measure of operations. Gross profit helps provide an understanding on the level of costs needed to create revenue.
Gross margin illustrates the gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Readers are cautioned that these non-IFRS
measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Readers are also cautioned not to
view these non-IFRS financial measures as an alternative to financial measures calculated in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). For more information with respect to financial measures which
have not been defined by GAAP, including reconciliations to the closest comparable GAAP measure, see the "Non-
GAAP Measures and Additional GAAP Measures" section of the Company’s most recent MD&A which is available
on SEDAR.
