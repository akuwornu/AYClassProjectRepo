The following information was released by Stanford University:

The Sustainability Accelerator at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability has named five new targets for its
efforts to help people, economies, and ecosystems thrive worldwide by rapidly translating Stanford research into
applied policy and technology solutions.

Ranging from food and agriculture to electricity and grid systems, the new targets join the Accelerators first Flagship
Destination, which involves channeling resources toward Stanford-led projects that can help enable the removal of
billions of tons of greenhouse gases annually from Earths atmosphere by the middle of this century.

The Accelerator will offer multi-year seed grants of up to $1 million per project under each of the new Flagship
Destinations, which were selected after extensive discussions with faculty, staff, students, and external experts.

These projects will support the schools broader efforts, announced on Aug. 6, to focus research on a set of Solution
Areas that includes climate, water, energy, food, nature, and cities, among other topics.

Sustainability safety net

Destinations matter. Thinking big matters. This dramatic expansion of the Accelerators efforts recognizes both the
magnitude of the challenges we face and the tremendous potential for realizing real and measurable impact, said
Dean Arun Majumdar. This moment also reflects the schools core commitment to leveraging our expertise and skills
across our entire research enterprise, from discovery to solutions to impact.

The new Flagship Destinations are climate adaptation, food and agriculture, water, electricity and grid systems, and
industry. Additional work supporting all the Accelerators targets will focus on improving sensing, measurement, and
data analytics, and on leveraging biological systems to help solve challenges within any one of the Flagship
Destinations. For example, bioengineering could contribute to the production of alternative protein sources.

The fundamental goal of the Accelerator is sustainability impact at global scale. These Flagship Destinations
represent targets where we see significant opportunities to protect or restore resources worldwide, said Yi Cui,
faculty director of the Sustainability Accelerator and the Fortinet Founders Professor in the School of Engineering

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3

and the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. He emphasized that the targets are not mutually exclusive. They
are intertwined and inseparable. They weave a sustainability safety net for the world.

Ingenuity and cooperation

Faculty, staff, and students from across the university provided input and feedback to inform the new lineup of
Flagship Destinations. Accelerator leadership, guided by a Faculty Advisory Council, also consulted external
experts from non-governmental organizations and industry professionals with unique expertise in sustainability.

Each Flagship Destination was chosen for its potential to rapidly apply Stanford research to address climate
change, biodiversity loss, disaster risk, and other sustainability challenges prioritized under the schools Solution
Areas. Todays sustainability challenges are daunting, but we can tackle them with human ingenuity and
cooperation, said Accelerator executive director Charlotte Pera. Our Flagship Destinations are ambitious,
commensurate with the scale of the challenges we face, and Stanford can make substantial contributions to each
one. We look forward to working with creative and committed teams from across the university to accelerate
innovative solutions and have impact at scale.

Flagship Destinations

Climate adaptation: Improve the lives of one billion people by 2035 by enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening
resilience, protecting ecosystems, and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a focus on climate-related
extreme events.

Food and agriculture: Reduce gigatons per year of greenhouse gas emissions from food and agriculture systems by
2035 while supporting the global goals of ending hunger, supplying healthy diets, and ensuring sustainable food
production.

Water: Ensure availability, resiliency, sustainable management, and equitable access to clean water for all people,
agriculture, industry, and ecosystems while minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.

Electricity and grid systems: Reduce gigatons per year of greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector
globally by 2035 while driving toward zero-GHG, reliable, flexible, affordable, and socially just electricity for all by
2050.

Industry: Reduce gigatons per year of greenhouse gas emissions from industry by 2035 by launching solutions that
are market-competitive, sustainable, scalable, and equitable.

Greenhouse gas removal (announced 2023): Remove gigatons of carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide equivalents
from the atmosphere per year by mid-century through an integrated approach that will support the development of
needed technological, governance, financial, and other societal innovations, including addressing equity and justice
issues.

Two platforms cut across all six Flagship Destinations:

Planetary intelligence: Support all Flagship Destinations by addressing gaps in the observation system, establishing
measurement, and providing data-driven actionable insights through advanced techniques such as innovative
sensing technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).

Biological solutions for sustainability: Leverage biological systems across all Flagship Destinations to create and
enhance sustainability solutions.

What is a gigaton?

1 gigaton equals 1 billion metric tons. Annual global emissions of greenhouse gases are equivalent to about 60
gigatons of carbon dioxide. Most of these emissions come from burning fossil fuels.

For more information

Submit a proposal

The Sustainability Accelerator is issuing requests for proposals (RFPs) for multi-year seed grants of up to $1 million
across the five new Flagship Destinations and two new cross-cutting platforms.

RFPs for Climate Adaptation and Planetary Intelligence are open. RFPs for the remaining areas will be announced
in October 2024.

Proposals are welcome from any Stanford University or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory faculty. Involvement
of Stanford graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, non-PI-eligible staff, and external
partners is strongly encouraged.
