WISeKey Subsidiary WISeSat.Space to Bring Blockchain to Space for Improved Satellite Services

Will test the node operations from the new WISeSat Satellite to be launched with SpaceX at Vandenberg Space
Force Base in October this year.

Geneva, Switzerland – July 2, 2024: WISeKey International Holding Ltd. (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ:
WKEY), a global leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and Internet of Things (IoT) innovations, today announced
its subsidiary WISeSat.Space’s (“Company”) innovative project to bring blockchain technology to space, aimed at
improving various aspects of the satellite industry, including logistics, insurance, government regulations, and data
security. The Company expects to test operations of the blockchain nodes from the new WISeSat Satellite to be
launched with SpaceX later this year.

WISeSat.Space's project to operate blockchain nodes from space is set to transform the satellite value chain,
bringing unprecedented levels of transparency, trust, and efficiency. From logistics and insurance to governmental
functions and financial inclusion, the integration of blockchain and satellite technology holds immense potential. As
this innovative approach continues to develop, it promises to unlock new opportunities and drive significant
advancements across multiple industries, paving the way for a more connected and efficient world.

By using blockchain technology, WISeSat.Space is set to make satellite operations more reliable and accessible.
For example, one of the key uses of blockchain in satellite operations is smart contracts. These are self-executing
agreements where the terms are written into code and help automate processes like launching and operating
satellites, therefore reducing the need for middlemen and cutting down on human errors. This makes the entire
process more efficient and cost-effective. Blockchain will also provide a clear and unchangeable record of

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 3

transactions. This is expected to be especially useful for insurance companies, as it will ensure accurate and
verifiable information to assess risks and process claims fairly and quickly.

Using blockchain nodes in space will also significantly improve cybersecurity. Space-based nodes will be harder to
attack than those on Earth, making the blockchain network more secure. This extra layer of protection will ensure
that sensitive information remains safe. Moreover, space-based nodes will help decentralize the blockchain
network. Traditional networks often rely on nodes in specific locations, which can create vulnerabilities.

By adding space-based nodes, WISeSat.Space will make the network more distributed and resilient, reducing the
risk of failures. Operating blockchain nodes in space will also help reduce energy costs. Traditional data centers
use a lot of electricity for computing and cooling. In space, the naturally cold environment reduces the need for
cooling, which lowers energy consumption and makes the blockchain network more environmentally friendly.

Blockchain's transparency and traceability are expected to be beneficial for government functions related to
satellites. For instance, the licensing process for launching a satellite can be streamlined using blockchain, ensuring
all necessary approvals are met efficiently. Blockchain can also be used to monitor space operations, providing a
clear and tamper-proof record of activities, which is crucial for regulatory oversight. Integrating blockchain with
satellites will turn them into "smart emancipated devices."

These satellites can operate independently using smart contracts to execute tasks without constant human
intervention. This automation will make satellite operations more efficient and reduce the risk of human error.
Satellites will also play a crucial role in distributing blockchain information. They will act as nodes in a decentralized
blockchain network, ensuring data is distributed and synchronized globally. This is particularly important in remote
areas where traditional internet infrastructure is lacking. By using satellite connectivity, blockchain networks can
reach more people, promoting greater participation in the digital economy.

One of the most significant benefits of combining blockchain and satellite technology is promoting financial inclusion
in developing regions, such as Africa. Satellites can reach remote and underserved areas, providing connectivity
where traditional infrastructure is lacking. By integrating blockchain with satellite communications, unbanked
populations can gain access to financial services, enabling them to participate in the global economy. This can lead
to improved economic opportunities and a reduction in poverty levels.

With enhanced cybersecurity, true decentralization, and reduced energy costs, the future of blockchain in space
looks exceptionally promising.
