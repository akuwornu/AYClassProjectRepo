PALM BEACH, Fla., June 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The Virtual
production Market is projected to continue to grow significantly over the next several years. Virtual production
allows filmmakers to interactively visualize and explore digital scenes within the studio, such as realistic virtual
characters, three-dimensional graphics, and a real-time virtual interactive background environment. Over the years,
significant advancements in the field of virtual production have resulted in the introduction of solutions that allow
filmmakers to transfer an actor's motion-captured movement to virtual characters, which are then previewed in real-
time in conjunction with live-action footage and virtual set extension elements. Such solutions assist filmmakers in
planning and communicating their creative ideas in novel and intuitive ways. A report from SNS Insider said that:
“The Virtual Production Market Size was valued at USD 2.98 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 8.87
billion by 2031 and grow at a CAGR of 14.62 % over the forecast period 2024-2031.” The report added: “Based on
type, the virtual production market is segmented into Production, Pre-production, and Post-production.

In the virtual production market, the production phase is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR. The increased use
of virtual production technology aids in project front-loading, early evaluation and editing, and a reduction in the
need for guesswork while filming. It also contributes to a smoother phase and helps to limit post-production
expenses. This is primarily due to an increase in the number of movies and television shows produced entirely
through virtual production technology.” Active companies in the markets this week include Grom Social
Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:
CMCSA), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD).

SNS Insider added: “Based on offerings, the virtual production market is segmented into Hardware, Software, and
Services. The software segment controlled the majority of the virtual production market. During the forecast period,

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4

                                                   Increase

it is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR. The segment's dominance can be attributed to the growing demand for
VFX and computer-generated imagery (CGI) in films. Because of technological advancements, the combination of
various other next-generation technologies such as Machine Learning, AI, augmented and virtual reality (AR VR),
extended reality (XR), deep learning, and virtual production has boosted growth. Based on end-user, the virtual
production market is segmented into Movies, TV series, Online videos, Commercial ads, and Others. During the
forecast period, the television series segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR. Some of the factors driving
the fastest growth of the television series segment include the increasing dominance of OTT platforms and their
ability to reach a large number of audiences.”
