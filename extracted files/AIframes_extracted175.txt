PR NewswireWASHINGTON, Feb. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (NAIC) announced its 2024 strategic priorities. NAIC Members annually finalize the priorities and
discuss potential workplans after assigning committee responsibilities. "Built on the foundation of coordination,
cooperation, and collaboration, the state-based insurance regulatory system is well equipped to keep taking on the
shared challenges and responsibilities of a world more interconnected than ever before. The NAIC's regulatory
priorities for 2024 reflect our commitment to pursuing innovative and effective solutions to the most pressing issues
affecting consumers, the insurance sector, and markets," said NAIC President and Connecticut Insurance
Commissioner Andrew N. Mais.

NAIC 2024 Priorities (in alphabetical order)Climate Risks/Natural Catastrophes and Resilience: Mitigation,
consumer education, and closely working together remain central to tackling the threat posed by increased climate
risks. The NAIC's proposed National Climate Resilience Strategy for Insurance provides for a unified approach,
data collection and utilization, and resiliency actions, including the launch of a comprehensive NAIC Climate Risk
Dashboard to measure and evaluate protection gaps. Among its actions, the NAIC will also seek to create new
resilience tools, advocate for pre-disaster mitigation funding, and develop scenario analysis resources for state
regulators.Insurer Financial Oversight and Transparency: Aiming to enhance oversight and adapt to evolving
investment strategies, the NAIC's "Framework for Insurer Investment Regulation" will reduce blind reliance on credit
rating providers and modernize the role of the NAIC's Securities Valuation Office. Other strategic items include
developing a modernized Economic Scenario Generator, as well as continuing to implement the Asset Adequacy
Testing framework (AG 53) to bring greater transparency and precision to the assessment of cash flows for
insurers' structured securities holdings.Marketing of Insurance Products: State insurance regulators will once
again take a multipronged approach to protecting consumers from deceptive and misleading insurance marketing.
In addition to coordinating with Congress and federal agencies, state insurance regulators will strengthen
information sharing among their departments and develop a tool hosted at NAIC.org for consumers to check
insurance producers' licenses, with additional information available on state insurance department websites. Other
steps include modifying NAIC model laws to grant regulatory power over health insurance lead generators. To
further assist consumers and help close the protection gap for older adults, the NAIC continues to call for Congress
to restore states' regulatory authority over the Medicare Advantage market.Race and Insurance, Financial
Inclusion, and Protection Gaps: These interrelated, multifaceted issues span personal, political, and public policy
realms as they affect consumers, insurance regulation, and the industry. Dedicated to leading in each of these
critical areas, the NAIC will continue to identify related issues in 2024, focus on closing protection gaps and

widening financial inclusion, receive updates, and recommend statutory or regulatory changes.Use of AI by
Insurers and Cyber Risk: The rapid development and use of artificial intelligence and other technologies create
opportunity but also raise key questions regarding consumer privacy, cyber risk, carrier needs and capabilities, and
the complexity of the regulatory landscape. The NAIC's Innovation, Cybersecurity, and Technology (H) Committee
positions the organization on the front lines of this field. In 2024, among other items, the NAIC's agenda includes
facilitating educational and engagement opportunities, leading key projects and efforts to monitor and support
adoption of the Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers, researching and
monitoring trends, proposing a regulatory framework for overseeing third-party data and predictive models, and
completing the development of the Cybersecurity Event Response Plan. Through the Privacy Protections (H)
Working Group, state insurance regulators are focusing on the future of safeguarding consumers' sensitive
information through modernized and enhanced privacy protections.In addition to our strategic regulatory priorities,
NAIC Members will continue to implement and execute on critical model law and model bulletin adoption, work
toward comparability for our Aggregation Method internationally, and focus on enhanced Member service and
connectivity through our State Connected strategic plan.About the National Association of Insurance
CommissionersAs part of our state-based system of insurance regulation in the United States, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides expertise, data, and analysis for insurance
commissioners to effectively regulate the industry and protect consumers. The U.S. standard-setting organization is
governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.
Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and
coordinate regulatory oversight. NAIC staff supports these efforts and represents the collective views of state
regulators      domestically    and       internationally.          View    original     content    to    download
