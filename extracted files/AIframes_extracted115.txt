at ultra-high 1000 T magnetic fieldsAkihiko IkedaAssistant Professor, Department of Engineering
ScienceAkihiko Ikeda introduces his research on condensed matter physics, particularly the effects of high
magnetic fields up to 1000 Tesla on materials. Under these extreme magnetic conditions, changes occur not only in
electron spin but also in the electronic, phononic, optical, and lattice states. Ikeda's primary goal is to observe
material phase transitions leading to entirely new crystal structures unique to very high magnetic fields.Video

revolutionizing wireless communications and networking through the integration of AI technologies.Suto is focused
on the integration of joint source and channel coding using deep neural networks.

In current wireless communication systems like 4G and 5G, source coding caters to user services, but
communication quality suffers due to non-optimized channel coding, leading to issues like block noise in video
transmissions.Video

Communicationshttp://www.uec.ac.jp/The University of Electro-Communications (UEC) in Tokyo is a small,
luminous university at the forefront of pure and applied sciences, engineering, and technology research. Its roots go
back to the Technical Institute for Wireless Commutations, which was established in 1918 by the Wireless
Association to train so-called wireless engineers in maritime communications in response to the Titanic disaster in
1912. In 1949, the UEC was established as a national university by the Japanese Ministry of Education and moved
in 1957 from Meguro to its current Chofu campus Tokyo.With approximately 4,000 students and 350 faculty
members, UEC is regarded as a small university, but with expertise in wireless communications, laser science,
robotics, informatics, and material science, to name just a few areas of research.                    View original
