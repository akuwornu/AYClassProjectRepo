resolutely resist zero-sum games and decoupling and severing industrial and supply chains, and work together to
build a Lancang-Mekong home that shares weal and woe in solidarity. The LMC countries should uphold the spirit
of openness and inclusiveness and actively explore tripartite cooperation with the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other international
organizations to boost the development of countries in the region.

China is ready to work with Mekong countries to uphold the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable

legal cooperation mechanisms, step up joint efforts to combat transnational"criminal activities, and jointly safeguard
regional stability and tranquility.
