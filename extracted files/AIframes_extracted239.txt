PR NewswireEmpowering IT to Protect Against and Respond to Cyber Threats, while Engaging in Ongoing
Defense RefinementANN ARBOR, Mich., March 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --OTAVA®, global leader in secure and
compliant multi-cloud solutions, today unveiled its S.E.C.U.R.E.™ Framework, created to help organizations
significantly improve their security posture through evaluation, analysis, and step-by-step actions.

 Today's dynamic climate demands a layered approach to security so that, when necessary, businesses can
minimize downtime and mitigate potential damage. OTAVA's S.E.C.U.R.E. Framework is a strategic process that
delivers isolated and controlled best practices for implementing a strengthened security posture across the entire IT
ecosystem.Based on an acronym that stands for Shrink, Examine, Contain, Undo, Recover, and Evaluate,
OTAVA's S.E.C.U.R.E. Framework represents an incremental path that leads organizations to an understanding of
the areas of vulnerability and guides them on how to fortify their business continuity."With AI fully in the mix, cyber
threats have reached a tipping point. Attack vectors are changing so fast that it has become nearly impossible to
avoid being breached, hacked, or otherwise compromised," said Brian Hoekelman, Vice President of Business
Development, OTAVA. "Achieving a strong cybersecurity strategy is complex and can be overwhelming. We
created the S.E.C.U.R.E. Framework to help businesses know where to start. It carves out the individual aspects of
security so that each can be assessed and acted on more easily and effectively."OTAVA's S.E.C.U.R.E. Framework
results in a blueprint for protection. The elements include:Shrink:� Reduce the size of the attack surface�and
protect�access points.

Examine:��Monitor�and analyze�anomalies and event threats.

Contain:� Restrict the�attack vectors to reduce the proliferation of any attack.

Undo:� Take action�to�isolate and restore infected�data.

Recover:� Achieve�business continuity�of operations.

Evaluate:�Engage in continuous improvement of your�security posture.OTAVA provides world-class cloud
