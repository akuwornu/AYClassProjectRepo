RPM International Inc. (NYSE: RPM), a world leader in specialty coatings, sealants and building materials, today
reported record financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year ended May 31, 2024.

"We achieved record adjusted EBIT for the 10th consecutive quarter due to our strategic balance and our ability to
leverage MAP 2025 operating improvement initiatives to increase profitability," said Frank C. Sullivan, RPM
chairman and CEO. "Construction Products Group captured growth opportunities with its differentiated turnkey
roofing offerings and wall systems, while Consumer generated record adjusted EBIT, despite continued DIY
softness, due to its MAP 2025 initiatives and ability to win market share. Although Performance Coatings Group and
Specialty Products Group faced headwinds, we still generated positive organic sales growth on a consolidated
basis."

Sullivan continued, "For the full fiscal year, we achieved record sales, profitability and operating cash flow as a
result of good execution on factors we could control, including structural margin and working capital improvements.
Our adjusted EBIT finished in the guidance range we provided 12 months ago as our teams nimbly captured growth
opportunities in markets that were more challenging than expected and focused on initiatives that resulted in
improved profitability."

Positive organic growth, including slightly positive pricing, was more than offset by foreign currency translation
headwinds and divestitures, resulting in an overall sales decline. Volume growth was strongest in businesses that
were positioned to serve high-performance new building projects and renovations. Market share gains also
contributed to volumes. This was offset by weakness in the disaster restoration business, unfavorable timing of
project completions, and lower DIY consumer takeaway at retail stores.

Geographically, sales increased slightly in North America, while emerging markets generally declined due to foreign
currency translation headwinds and challenging comparisons. European sales also declined due to foreign currency
translation headwinds, divestitures and initiatives to focus on higher-margin business.

Sales included a 0.4% organic increase, a 0.1% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions, and a 0.7% decline
from foreign currency translation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to incentives to sell higher-margin products and
services, investments to accelerate long-term growth, and inflation in compensation and benefits. Several MAP
2025-enabled initiatives to streamline the selling, general and administrative expense structure were implemented
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

Fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT was a record, driven by MAP 2025 initiatives, including the commodity
cycle recovery, positive mix from shifting toward higher margin products and services, and improved fixed-cost
leverage at businesses with volume growth. In Europe, although sales declined, a focused strategy to leverage
MAP 2025 initiatives improved profitability in the region.

CPG fourth-quarter sales were a record with broad-based strength led by turnkey roofing systems, wall systems
and products serving infrastructure-related projects, including those that lower the carbon footprint of projects.
There was strength in both new construction projects and renovations.

Sales included 6.6% organic growth, 0.5% growth from acquisitions, and a 0.5% decline from foreign currency
translation.

Record fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by improved fixed-cost leverage from volume growth, MAP 2025
benefits and favorable mix. Variable compensation increased as a result of improved financial performance.

PCG sales declined as a result of challenging comparisons in the prior-year period and the unfavorable timing of
project completions, as well as pockets of weakness in Europe. Foreign currency translation and the prior
divestiture of a non-core European service business also contributed to the sales decline. The flooring business
generated positive growth in the U.S., despite a challenging comparison.

Sales included a 4.0% organic decline, a 1.3% decline from divestitures, and a 1.4% decline from foreign currency
translation.

The fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT decline was driven by the lower sales and reduced fixed-cost leverage from lower
volumes, partially offset by MAP 2025 benefits.

SPG's fourth-quarter sales decline was driven by challenging comparisons in the prior-year period for the disaster
restoration business. Additionally, specialty residential OEM end markets remained soft during the quarter.

Sales included an 8.1% organic decline and 0.1% growth from foreign currency translation.

Adjusted EBIT was negatively impacted by the sales decline and under absorption from lower volumes.

The Consumer Group's fourth-quarter sales decline was driven by weaker DIY takeaway at retail stores and the
rationalization of lower-margin products. Market share gains, aided by new products, and growth initiatives in
international markets helped offset the overall sales decline.

Sales included a 1.2% organic decline and a 0.7% decline from foreign currency translation.

Record fourth-quarter adjusted EBIT was driven by MAP 2025 benefits and the rationalization of lower margin
products, partially offset by unfavorable fixed-cost absorption from lower volumes, and compensation and benefits
inflation.

Fiscal year 2024 sales were a record, driven by strength in CPG and PCG, which have positioned themselves to
provide engineered solutions for infrastructure and high-performance building projects, including reshoring projects.
Partially offsetting this growth was the Consumer Group, which experienced soft DIY demand and SPG, which
faced weak demand, particularly in disaster restoration and specialty residential OEM markets.

Record adjusted EBIT was driven by MAP 2025 benefits, including the commodity cycle, better mix and improved
fixed-cost leverage at businesses that generated volume growth. The record adjusted EBIT was achieved despite
an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from incentives to sell higher-margin products and
services; investments to accelerate long-term growth; and inflation in compensation and benefits.

Cash Flow and Financial Position

During fiscal 2024:

                                                                                                       Page 5 of 17
                      RPM Reports Record Fiscal 2024 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Results

    •   Cash provided by operating activities was $1.12 billion compared to $577.1 million in the prior year, with
        the increase driven by improved profitability and working capital efficiency, both of which were enabled by
        MAP 2025 initiatives.
    •   Capital expenditures were $214.0 million compared to $254.4 million during the prior year.
    •   The company returned $286.9 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.

As of May 31, 2024:
    •   Total debt was $2.13 billion compared to $2.68 billion a year ago, with the $556.7 million reduction driven
        by improved cash flow being used to repay higher-cost debt.
    •   Total liquidity, including cash and committed revolving credit facilities, was $1.36 billion, compared to $1.03
        billion a year ago.

Business Outlook

"As we enter fiscal year 2025, we remain focused on things we can control in a mixed economic environment.
These include outgrowing our markets, improving operating cash flow, and leveraging the power of RPM through
MAP 2025 initiatives. The structural improvements we are making through MAP 2025 are helping us navigate the
current economic landscape, and their impact will be even more evident when end markets improve."

The company expects the following in the fiscal 2025 first quarter:
    •   Consolidated sales to be approximately flat compared to prior-year record results.
    •   CPG sales to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record results.
    •   PCG sales to be flat compared to prior-year record results.
    •   SPG sales to decrease in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year results.
    •   Consumer Group sales to decrease in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record
        results.
    •   Consolidated adjusted EBIT to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year
        record results.

The company expects the following in the full-year fiscal 2025:
    •   Consolidated sales to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to prior-year record
        results.
    •   Consolidated adjusted EBIT to increase in the mid-single to low-double-digit percentage range compared
        to prior-year record results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

To supplement the financial information presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States ("GAAP") in this earnings release, we use EBIT, adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share,
which are all non-GAAP financial measures. EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes, with
adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share provided for the purpose of adjusting for one-off items impacting
revenues and/or expenses that are not considered by management to be indicative of ongoing operations. We
evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before income taxes, but also look to EBIT as a
performance evaluation measure because interest income (expense), net is essentially related to corporate
functions, as opposed to segment operations. For that reason, we believe EBIT is also useful to investors as a
metric in their investment decisions. EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than,
income before income taxes as determined in accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest and
investment income or expense in determining operating performance, which represent items necessary to our
continued operations, given our level of indebtedness. Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful
to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that
this measure is critical to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also
evaluate EBIT because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing. Our underwriters
and bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt
underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be
predictive of potential future results. See the financial statement section of this earnings release for a reconciliation
of EBIT and adjusted EBIT to income before income taxes, and adjusted earnings per share to earnings per share.
We have not provided a reconciliation of our first-quarter fiscal 2025 or full-year fiscal 2025 adjusted EBIT guidance
because material terms that impact such measure are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and
therefore a reconciliation of such measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

    (a)                  The presentation includes a reconciliation of Income (Loss) Before Income
                         Taxes, a measure defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the
                         United States (GAAP), to EBIT and Adjusted EBIT.
    (b)                  Interest Income (Expense), Net includes the combination of Interest Income
                         (Expense) and Investment Income (Expense), Net.
    (c)                  EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes, with Adjusted
                         EBIT provided for the purpose of adjusting for items impacting earnings that
                         are not considered by management to be indicative of ongoing operations. We
                         evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before
                         income taxes, but also look to EBIT, or adjusted EBIT, as a performance
                         evaluation measure because Interest Income (Expense), Net is essentially
                         related to corporate functions, as opposed to segment operations. For that
                         reason, we believe EBIT is also useful to investors as a metric in their
                         investment decisions. EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or
                         more meaningful than, income before income taxes as determined in
                         accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest and
                         investment income or expense in determining operating performance, which
                         represent items necessary to our continued operations, given our level of
                         indebtedness. Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful to
                         our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of
                         whom believe, and we concur, that this measure is critical to the capital
                         markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also
                         evaluate EBIT because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to
                         attract financing. Our underwriters and bankers consistently require inclusion
                         of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt
                         underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical
                         operating results, nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results.

                                                                                                        Page 11 of 17

(d)                       Reflects restructuring and other charges, which have been incurred in relation
                          to our Margin Acceleration Plan ("MAP to Growth") and our Margin
                          Achievement Plan ("MAP 2025"), together MAP initiatives, as follows: -
                          Restructuring and other related expense, net: Includes charges incurred
                          related to headcount reductions, facility closures and asset impairments
                          recorded in "Restructuring Expense" on the Consolidated Statements of
                          Income. Restructuring Expense totaled $15.9 million and $8.7 million for the
                          quarters ended May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023 respectively, and $30.0
                          million and $15.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023
                          respectively. Other related expenses include inventory write-offs in connection
                          with restructuring activities recorded in "Cost of Sales" and accelerated
                          depreciation and amortization recorded within "Cost of Sales" or "Selling,
                          General, & Administrative Expenses ("SG&A")" depending on the nature of the
                          expense as well as the increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a
                          result of the divestiture of the non-core Universal Sealant's Bridgecare service
                          business within our PCG segment. The charges in fiscal 2023 were partially
                          offset by the gain on the sale of one our closed facilities in SPG. - Exited
                          product lines: Reflects the sale of inventory that had previously been reserved
                          for as a result of prior product line rationalization initiatives at PCG partially
                          offset by inventory write-offs related to the discontinuation of certain product
                          lines within our SPG segment. In the prior year these adjustments reflect
                          prepaid asset and inventory write-offs related to the discontinuation of certain
                          product lines within our PCG and SPG segments. In both years, these
                          amounts resulted from ongoing product line rationalization efforts in
                          connection with our MAP initiatives and were recorded within "Cost of Sales".
                          - ERP consolidation plan: Includes expenses incurred as a result of our stated
                          goals to consolidate over 75 ERP systems across the organization to four ERP
                          platforms, one per segment, as part of our overall MAP strategy as well as
                          costs incurred for other decision support tools to facilitate our commercial
                          initiatives related to MAP 2025 which have been incurred in our CPG, PCG,
                          SPG and Corporate/Other segments and have been recorded within "SG&A".
                          - Professional fees: Includes expenses incurred to consolidate accounting
                          locations, costs incurred to implement technologies and processes to drive
                          improved sales mix and salesforce effectiveness and cost incurred to
                          implement new global manufacturing methodologies with the goal of improving
                          operating efficiency incurred within our CPG, PCG, SPG, and Corporate/Other
                          segments and recorded within "SG&A". All of this spend is in support of stated
                          MAP goals with the most significant expense incurred within our
                          Corporate/Other segment. - Goodwill impairment: Relates to an impairment
                          charge at our Universal Sealants ("USL") reporting unit as a result of a
                          decision to exit the services portion of that business which has been recorded
                          in "Goodwill Impairment" in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Included below is a

(d)    Reflects restructuring and other charges, which have been incurred in relation to our Margin
       Acceleration Plan ("MAP to Growth") and our Margin Achievement Plan ("MAP 2025"), together MAP
       initiatives, as follows: - Restructuring and other related expense, net: Includes charges incurred
       related to headcount reductions, facility closures and asset impairments recorded in "Restructuring
       Expense" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring Expense totaled $15.9 million
       and $8.7 million for the quarters ended May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023 respectively, and $30.0
       million and $15.5 million for the year ended May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023 respectively. Other
       related expenses include inventory write-offs in connection with restructuring activities recorded in
       "Cost of Sales" and accelerated depreciation and amortization recorded within "Cost of Sales" or

                                                                                                        Page 14 of 17

       "Selling, General, & Administrative Expenses ("SG&A")" depending on the nature of the expense as
       well as the increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of the divestiture of the non-
       core Universal Sealant's Bridgecare service business within our PCG segment. The charges in fiscal
       2023 were partially offset by the gain on the sale of one our closed facilities in SPG. - Exited product
       lines: Reflects the sale of inventory that had previously been reserved for as a result of prior product
       line rationalization initiatives at PCG partially offset by inventory write-offs related to the
       discontinuation of certain product lines within our SPG segment. In the prior year these adjustments
       reflect prepaid asset and inventory write-offs related to the discontinuation of certain product lines
       within our PCG and SPG segments. In both years, these amounts resulted from ongoing product line
       rationalization efforts in connection with our MAP initiatives and were recorded within "Cost of Sales".
       - ERP consolidation plan: Includes expenses incurred as a result of our stated goals to consolidate
       over 75 ERP systems across the organization to four ERP platforms, one per segment, as part of our
       overall MAP strategy as well as costs incurred for other decision support tools to facilitate our
       commercial initiatives related to MAP 2025 which have been incurred in our CPG, PCG, SPG and
       Corporate/Other segments and have been recorded within "SG&A". - Professional fees: Includes
       expenses incurred to consolidate accounting locations, costs incurred to implement technologies and
       processes to drive improved sales mix and salesforce effectiveness and cost incurred to implement
       new global manufacturing methodologies with the goal of improving operating efficiency incurred
       within our CPG, PCG, SPG, and Corporate/Other segments and recorded within "SG&A". All of this
       spend is in support of stated MAP goals with the most significant expense incurred within our
       Corporate/Other segment. - Goodwill impairment: Relates to an impairment charge at our Universal
       Sealants ("USL") reporting unit as a result of a decision to exit the services portion of that business
       which has been recorded in "Goodwill Impairment" in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
 (e)   The current year adjustment reflects the gain associated with post-closing adjustments for the sale of
       the furniture warranty business in the SPG segment as well as the sale of a property within our
       Consumer segment which have been recorded in "SG&A". The prior year balance reflects the gains
       associated with the sale of the furniture warranty business and the sale and leaseback of a facility in
       the SPG segment recorded within "Gain on Sales of Assets and Business, Net".
 (f)   Business interruption insurance recovery at our Consumer segment related to lost sales and
       incremental costs incurred during fiscal 2021 and 2022 as a result of an explosion at the plant of a
       significant alkyd resin supplier, which has been recorded in "SG&A".
 (g)   Represents incremental expense related to an adverse legal ruling from a case associated with a
       business that was divested in the prior year. We strongly disagree with the legal ruling and have filed
       an appeal.
 (h)   Adjustment to income taxes associated with the prior year sale of the furniture warranty business.
 (i)   Investment returns include realized net gains and losses on sales of investments and unrealized net
       gains and losses on equity securities, which are adjusted due to their inherent volatility. Management
       does not consider these gains and losses, which cannot be predicted with any level of certainty, to be
       reflective of the Company's core business operations.
 (j)   Adjusted Diluted EPS is provided for the purpose of adjusting diluted earnings per share for items
       impacting earnings that are not considered by management to be indicative of ongoing operations.
