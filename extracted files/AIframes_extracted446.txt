Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Results

The Company reported fee revenue in Q4 FY'24 of $690.8 million, a decrease of 5% in both actual and constant
currency compared to Q4 FY'23. Moderation in fee revenue from our talent acquisition offerings was buoyed by
year-over-year growth in our Consulting fee revenue and stability in our Digital fee revenue, in-line with our
business diversification strategy. The moderation in fee revenue in our talent acquisition offerings was driven by the
challenging global economic environment (the "economic environment").

Operating income was $83.5 million (at an operating margin of 12.1%) in Q4 FY'24, compared to $72.6 million (at
an operating margin of 9.9%) in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 15% (and 220bps). Net income attributable to
Korn Ferry was $65.2 million in Q4 FY'24, compared to $47.5 million in Q4 FY'23. Adjusted EBITDA was $112.3
million in Q4 FY'24 compared to $97.9 million in Q4 FY'23. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.3% in Q4 FY'24, an
increase of 290bps.

Operating income and margin increased as a result of pro-active workforce capacity management ("workforce
actions") taken during the year and the lower cost of services expense and integration/acquisition costs compared
to the year-ago quarter. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in fee revenue discussed above. Net
income attributable to Korn Ferry increased due to the same factors discussed above.

Adjusted EBITDA and margin increased due to the same factors discussed above, but excluded
integration/acquisition costs.

Fiscal 2024 Full Year Results

The Company reported fee revenue in FY'24 of $2,762.7 million, a decrease of 3% in both actual and constant
currency compared to FY'23. Fee revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in our permanent placement talent
acquisition offerings, due to the economic environment. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in fee
revenue from the Interim portion of Professional Search & Interim, resulting from the acquisitions of Infinity
Consulting Solutions and Salo, which were acquired on August 1, 2022, and February 1, 2023, respectively, as well
as year-over-year growth in Consulting and Digital fee revenue, again, in-line with our business diversification
strategy.

Operating income was $212.9 million (margin of 7.7%) in FY'24, compared to $316.3 million (margin of 11.2%) in
FY'23. Net income attributable to Korn Ferry was $169.2 million in FY'24 compared to $209.5 million in FY'23.
Adjusted EBITDA was $408.2 million (adjusted EBITDA margin 14.8%) in FY'24 compared to $457.3 million
(adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1%) in FY'23.

Operating income and margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in fee revenue from our permanent placement
talent acquisition offerings, which have higher margins, an increase in Interim fee revenue (lower margins) and cost
of services expense, and higher restructuring charges, net recorded during FY'24 compared to the year-ago period.
These decreases were partially offset by decreases in compensation and benefits expense resulting from workforce
actions taken during FY'24, and lower impairment charges of both fixed and right of use assets. Net income
attributable to Korn Ferry declined due to the same factors discussed above partially offset by a lower effective tax
rate in the current year.

Adjusted EBITDA and margin decreased due to the same factors as operating income discussed above excluding
the restructuring charges.

Fee revenue was $182.2 million in Q4 FY'24 compared to $175.3 million in Q4 FY'23, an increase of $6.9 million or
4% (up 5% on a constant currency basis). Growth was strongest in our assessment & succession solutions,
leadership development, and organizational strategy offerings, with all product areas posting year-over-year
increases in fee revenue. Fee revenue was also positively impacted by a year-over-year 12% increase in our
average bill rate to $437 per hour.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $32.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of FY'23. Adjusted EBITDA margin
in the quarter increased year-over-year by 380bps to 17.8% this year. These increases resulted primarily from
higher fee revenue in the previously discussed solution areas, higher bill rates, and workforce actions taken during
the year and were slightly offset by an increase in cost of services expense and higher general and administrative
expenses.

Fee revenue was $198.7 million and $212.6 million in Q4 FY'24 and Q4 FY'23, respectively, a decrease of $13.9
million or 7% (down 6% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in fee revenue was primarily driven by a
decline in the number of Executive Search engagements billed, as a result of the current economic environment.

Adjusted EBITDA was $45.5 million in Q4 FY'24 compared to $42.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased by 280bps to 22.9% in Q4 FY'24. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin was primarily due to workforce actions taken during the year and increased consultant productivity,
partially offset by the decrease in fee revenue discussed above.

Fee revenue was $129.2 million in Q4 FY'24, a decrease of $22.5 million or 15% in both actual and constant
currency. The decrease in fee revenue in both the Permanent Placement and Interim portions of the business
resulted from the economic environment and, in the case of the Interim portion, the continued wind-down during Q4
FY'23 of a non-recurring engagement that ultimately concluded in Q1 FY'24.

Adjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million in Q4 FY'24 compared to $27.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased year-over-year by 380bps to 21.8% in Q4 FY'24. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the lower cost of services expense, combined with decreases in
compensation and benefit and general and administrative expense (both excluding integration/acquisition costs) as
a result of workforce and other cost saving actions, partially offset by the decrease in fee revenue discussed above.

Fee revenue was $89.5 million in Q4 FY'24, a decrease of $10.3 million or 10% in both actual and constant
currency. RPO fee revenue decreased due to moderation in the hiring volume in the existing base of clients due to
the economic environment, a higher percentage of FY'24 new business coming from renewals and extensions
versus new logos, as well as a continuation of clients' "labor hoarding" throughout the year.

Adjusted EBITDA was $11.8 million in Q4 FY'24 compared to $9.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased 420bps to 13.2% in Q4 FY'24. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
both resulted from the workforce actions taken during the year, partially offset by the decline in fee revenue
discussed above.

Outlook

Assuming worldwide geopolitical conditions, economic conditions, financial markets and foreign exchange rates
remain steady, on a consolidated basis:
   •        Q1 FY'25 fee revenue is expected to be in the range of $655 million and $675 million; and
   •        Q1 FY'25 diluted earnings per share is expected to range between $1.05 to $1.15.

On a consolidated adjusted basis:
   •        Q1 FY'25 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range from $1.07 to $1.17.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). In particular, it includes:

                                                                                               Page 11 of 23

                                                 Highlights

    •   Adjusted net income attributable to Korn Ferry, adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs,
        impairment of fixed assets, impairment of right of use assets, and restructuring charges, net of income tax
        effect and to exclude a $9.7 million non-recurring tax benefit from actions taken in connection with the
        worldwide minimum tax that resulted in the release of a valuation allowance;
    •   Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs,
        impairment of fixed assets, impairment of right of use assets, and restructuring charges, net of income tax
        effect, and to exclude a $9.7 million non-recurring tax benefit from actions taken in connection with the
        worldwide minimum tax that resulted in the release of a valuation allowance;
    •   Constant currency (calculated using a quarterly average) percentages that represent the percentage
        change that would have resulted had exchange rates in the prior period been the same as those in effect in
        the current period; and
    •   Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA, which is earnings before interest, taxes,
        depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs, impairment of fixed
        assets, impairment of right of use assets and restructuring charges, net when applicable, and Consolidated
        and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA margin.

This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial
information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP
performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release provides meaningful
supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance by excluding certain charges that may not be
indicative of Korn Ferry's ongoing operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are performance
measures and are not indicative of the liquidity of Korn Ferry. These charges, which are described in the footnotes
in the attached reconciliations, represent 1) costs we incurred to acquire and integrate a portion of our Professional
Search & Interim business, 2) impairment of fixed assets primarily due to a software impairment charge in our
Digital segment in FY'24 and impairment on leasehold improvements due to terminating and deciding to sublease
some of our office leases in FY'23, 3) impairment of right of use assets due to the decision to terminate and
sublease some of our offices, 4) restructuring charges, net to align workforce to the challenging macroeconomic
business environment arising from persistent inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and global economic and
geopolitical uncertainty and 5) to exclude a $9.7 million non-recurring tax benefit from actions taken in connection
with the worldwide minimum tax that resulted in the release of a valuation allowance. The use of non-GAAP
financial measures facilitates comparisons to Korn Ferry's historical performance. Korn Ferry includes non-GAAP
financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency
with respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing operations
and financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted net income attributable to Korn Ferry, adjusted basic and
diluted earnings per share and Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA, exclude certain charges that
management does not consider on-going in nature and allows management and investors to make more
meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results. Management further believes that
Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by
investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital
structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes and capitalized asset values, all of which can vary substantially from
company to company. In the case of constant currency percentages, management believes the presentation of
such information provides useful supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance as excluding the
impact of exchange rate changes on Korn Ferry's financial performance allows investors to make more meaningful
period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results, to better identify operating trends that may
otherwise be masked or distorted by exchange rate changes and to perform related trend analysis, and provides a
higher degree of transparency of information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing
operations and financial and operational decision-making.
