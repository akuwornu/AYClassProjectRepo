Biological Detection for the 21st Century (BD21).--The Committee is disappointed that CWMD's budget submission
continues to omit funding for the BD21 program; the program is designed to procure innovative technologies to
improve detection capabilities of airborne bio-threats. The recommendation includes $50,000,000 to further the
capabilities of the BD21 program to include procurement of technologies that mitigate capability vulnerabilities in the
current BioWatch infrastructure as identified by GAO, SLTT, and other industry stakeholders. Within 90 days of the
date of enactment of this Act, CWMD shall submit a spend plan outlining how these additional funds will be utilized,
as well as a procurement timeline. Further, the Committee directs CWMD to consult with SLTT stakeholders to
determine their biodetection needs and within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act provide a report
summarizing the results of that consultation and how those results will be used by CWMD.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).--AMR presents a growing threat to national security. The Committee supports the
recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) to
designate AMR as a material threat, thereby unlocking additional resources for development and stockpiling of
critical countermeasures. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to initiate an evaluation, assessment,
and determination of the material threat of AMR in accordance with the March 2023 PACCARB report
recommendation.

BioWatch.--The Committee, GAO, and independent organizations, such as the Bipartisan Commission on
Biodefense, have had longstanding concerns about the security value provided by BioWatch. The current program

is incapable of identifying biological threats in a timely and accurate manner due to a prolonged event-to-detection
timeline. According to the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, hospitals receiving patients from a suspected
incident would likely detect a biological attack well before detection through BioWatch. As a result, the
recommendation does not include funding for the current BioWatch program and instead includes $50,000,000 for
the BD21 program to examine follow-on capabilities. The Committee directs CWMD to terminate the BioWatch
program.

Section 503. The Committee continues a provision related to reprogramming limitations and transfer authority.

The Department must notify the Committees on Appropriations at least 30 days in advance of each reprogramming
of funds that would: (1) reduce programs, projects, and activities, or personnel, by ten percent or more; or (2)
increase a program, project, or activity by more than $5,000,000 or ten percent, whichever is less.

The term "program, project, and activity" (PPA) is defined as each functional category listed under an account
heading in the funding table at the back of this report, along with each funding amount designated for a particular
purpose within the statement narrative, exclusive of simple references to increases or reductions below the budget
request. Funding for each PPA should not be used for the purposes of any other PPA. Within 30 days of the date of
enactment of this Act, the Department shall submit to the Committees a table delineating PPAs subject to section
503 notification requirements.

For purposes of reprogramming notifications, the creation of a new program, project, or activity is defined as any
significant new activity that has not been explicitly justified to the Congress in budget justification material and for
which funds have not been appropriated by the Congress.

Limited transfer authority is provided to give the Department flexibility in responding to emerging requirements and
significant changes in circumstances, but is not intended to facilitate the implementation of new programs, projects,
or activities that were not proposed in a formal budget submission. Transfers may not reduce accounts by more
than five percent or augment appropriations by more than ten percent. The Department must notify the Committees
on Appropriations not fewer than 30 days in advance of any transfer. To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act,
the Secretary shall ensure that any transfer of funds is carried out in compliance with the limitations and
requirements of section 503(c). In particular, the Secretary should ensure that any such transfers adhere to the
opinion of the Comptroller General's decision in the Matter of John D. Webster, Director, Financial Services, Library
of Congress, dated November 7, 1997, with regard to the definition
