The following information was released by Carnegie Mellon University:

$5 million in NSF funding will allow PSC to provide data-intensive computing and data mirroring to TACC-led,
distributed system

Today the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) announced it has begun construction of the Leadership-
Class Computing Facility (LCCF), a mammoth supercomputing system that will open up new opportunities in
computer simulation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics in transformational science and engineering
research.

The distributed computing facility, anchored by the new Horizon computer at TACC, will be the largest in the
National Science Foundation's ecosystem. Thanks to $5 million in NSF funding the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center (opens in new window), a joint center of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, is one
of four Distributed Science Centers that will leverage expertise across the broader cyberinfrastructure ecosystem
and provide critical edge computing services to the LCCF user community. PSC's role will be to provide data-
intensive computing and data mirrors for published archives, a method for copying data in real time so that a perfect
backup copy always exists for security and disaster-recovery purposes.

"LCCF represents a pivotal step forward in our mission to support transformative research across all fields of
science and engineering," said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. "This facility will provide the
computational resources necessary to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time, enabling
researchers to push the boundaries of what is possible."
