witnessed by the filmmaker on topics such as war, disaster, migration and gender.This year began with news of
ongoing conflicts and disasters. SSFF & ASIA will present films that illuminate "life," "living" and the "world" that
surrounds them under the theme "Illuminate Your Life." We hope these films will shine a light on the lives of
viewers, creating a place where empathy, discovery, and emotion are ignited, and an opportunity to open one's
eyes to the world.For the first time in the history of the festival, there will be a short film produced entirely by AI, a
story set in a Palestinian refugee camp, a documentary made from smartphone footage of survivors of a missile
attack, and a film that appeals to diversity, depicted against the backdrop of religious and cultural differences.The
complete SSFF & ASIA 2024 lineup will be announced on Thu April 25, including the five categories that will be
nominated for next year's Academy Awards (Live Action, Nonfiction, and Animation).First ever online marketplace
