Large Enterprises segment held a major market share in 2023. In the Backup and Disaster Recovery market, the
large enterprises segment is demonstrating significant leadership. These          organizations often have complex
infrastructures, extensive data assets, and critical operational dependencies that necessitate robust backup and
disaster recovery solutions. Their substantial           financial resources enable them to invest in advanced
technologies and comprehensive strategies to safeguard their data against a myriad of threats, ranging from
cyberattacks to natural    disasters. Furthermore, large enterprises are more likely to adhere to stringent regulatory
compliance requirements, driving the adoption of sophisticated disaster recovery solutions. The scale          of their
operations demands not only high-capacity storage solutions but also rapid recovery times to ensure business
continuity. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and best practices, large              enterprises are setting the
benchmark in the industry, pushing innovation and influencing market trends. Their proactive approach and
emphasis on resilience make them pivotal players in shaping            the future of backup and disaster recovery
strategies.

Regular Testing and Maintenance of Backup Systemsas A Major Challenge

Regular testing and maintenance of backup systems pose a significant challenge in the backup and disaster
recovery market. Ensuring that backups are consistently up-to-date and fully         operational requires continuous
oversight and resources. Often, businesses struggle to allocate the necessary time and expertise for thorough
testing, leading to potential vulnerabilities. The   complexity of modern data environments, combined with the
need for minimal downtime, further complicates this task. Without regular testing, companies risk discovering issues
only when a          disaster strikes, undermining their recovery efforts and compromising business continuity.

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 5
