Cequence announced today that the world's largest navigation device manufacturer has chosen the Cequence bot
detection and mitigation solution API Spartan, part of the overall Unified API Protection (UAP) platform , to secure
its e-commerce experience and deliver a frictionless shopping experience for its customers. The company joins an
already elite roster of clients, standing alongside industry giants spanning diverse sectors such as beauty, retail,
government, telecommunications, systems integration, international voice traffic carriers, online automotive,
motorcycle enthusiasts, and marine classifieds.

As the company aimed to boost online security, it faced alarming numbers: about 100 million SSO login requests
monthly, with 15 to 20 percent flagged as malicious. They also uncovered significant financial risks, with account
takeovers costing anywhere from $50 to $12,000 each. Ignoring these unsettling numbers might have spelled
financial disaster for the business, potentially surpassing the billion-dollar mark.

In light of the company's previous experience with a prominent internet security provider that utilized rudimentary
bot protection methods, it became evident that their efficacy in stopping malicious bots was compromised. The
previous solution relied solely on identifying bots based on bad IP addresses, which proved inadequate in detecting
many sophisticated malicious bots due to the lack of behavioral analysis. Consequently, the navigation device
manufacturer faced challenges in effectively mitigating bot attacks and ensuring business continuity and customer
experience.

Recognizing the limitations of their existing bot protection measures, the customer sought a more proactive and
comprehensive bot management solution like Cequence API Spartan to safeguard their business continuity, protect
their online assets and enhance the overall customer experience. Cequence's ability to distinguish genuine users
from bots in real time and adapt to evolving bot tactics resonated with the company, offering a reliable and future-
proof solution to their bot problem.

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 3

"Bots aren't just a technical nuisance; they're customer experience assassins," said Ameya Talwalkar, CEO of
Cequence. "Imagine loyal customers, eager to purchase your products, locked out by an army of automated bad
actors. The frustration, lost sales, and reputational damage are a nightmare scenario no business can afford. That's
why Cequence is dedicated to providing solutions that go beyond simple bot detection. We empower companies to
proactively safeguard their legitimate customers and foster a thriving online environment where trust and genuine
interactions flourish."

The OWASP API Security Top 10 highlights the vulnerability of poorly secured APIs to automated bot attacks. This
blurs the line between traditional API and bot attacks, requiring unified security solutions that address both. As the
only API security solution with bot management capabilities, Cequence provides the navigation device
manufacturer with:
    •   Continuous Behavior-based API Threat Detection: Cequence leverages the behavioral fingerprint created
        by a machine learning-based analytics engine to track sophisticated attacks continuously. Supported by
        the largest API threat database in the world, with millions of behavioral and malicious infrastructure
        records, the analysis results are translated into policies and models that can be implemented on day one
        for high-efficacy protection.
    •   Integrated Security Ecosystem: While Cequence offers native real-time attack mitigation capabilities, it
        seamlessly integrates with existing security solutions such as web application firewalls (WAFs). This
        collaborative approach ensures holistic protection, allowing organizations to leverage the strengths of
        multiple security tools for enhanced API security and threat mitigation.
    •   Protection in Minutes: Cequence can be enabled to protect your APIs and web applications in as little as
        15 minutes and can immediately begin reducing the operational burden associated with preventing attacks
        that can result in fraud, data loss and business disruption.

Today's e-commerce environment is increasingly vulnerable to bots exploiting loopholes in business logic.
Cequence offers a robust solution to protect web and mobile applications, as well as their underlying API
infrastructure, from business logic abuse. Leveraging advanced AI and machine learning, Cequence analyzes
incoming traffic to effectively identify and thwart even subtle attempts at exploitation.
