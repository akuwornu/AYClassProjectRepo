TAMPA, Flo., Feb. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectWise, the leading software company dedicated to
the success of technology solutions providers (TSPs), today announced it has made significant advancements in its
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution and ConnectWise Sidekick™, both of which leverage workflows, bots,
and artificial intelligence (AI) within the ConnectWise Asio™ platform. These groundbreaking developments are
revolutionizing the partner experience and transforming service delivery to small and medium-sized businesses
(SMBs), freeing them from mundane, repetitive tasks and empowering them to focus on strategic initiatives. The
highly anticipated unveiling occurred at the Automation Nation 2024 event, held at ConnectWise's headquarters in
Tampa, Florida.

ConnectWise RPA™ and ConnectWise Sidekick™ are integral components of the innovative Asio platform,
designed to enable greater automation, enhance efficiency, and accelerate business growth specifically for MSPs
(Managed Service Providers). By incorporating RPA options and AI functionality for technicians and seamlessly
integrating them within the Asio Platform, MSPs can optimize efficiency, reduce costs, and generate additional
revenue by implementing a fee structure that is not solely reliant on labor expenses. The solutions offer partners the
flexibility to choose alternative problem-solving approaches based on the strengths of the respective technology.

ConnectWise RPA was initially introduced with a clear objective in mind—to boost team productivity and streamline
operations by prioritizing daily tasks and addressing critical issues. However, ConnectWise's commitment to
innovation and empowering the IT channel ecosystem has led to more advancements in its RPA technology. These
enhancements include:

                                                                                                Page 2 of 3

    •    Streamlined Search Experience: ConnectWise has implemented a well-categorized RPA bot system on the
         search screen, enabling users to quickly locate and utilize the appropriate bots. This not only accelerates
         problem-solving but also enhances the overall client experience.
    •    Enhanced Onboarding Process: ConnectWise now provides warning messages for empty device
         configurations and missing parts during Microsoft onboarding. This proactive approach reduces
         deployment errors and effectively mitigates potential cybersecurity risks, ensuring a smoother onboarding
         experience.
    •    Improved Limitations: ConnectWise has addressed limitations by introducing enhancements such as
         increased site mapping capabilities. This improvement allows for more comprehensive and accurate data
         mapping, resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy in RPA operations.
    •    Streamlined Device and Client Management: ConnectWise has introduced device and company sorting
         features in RPA bot input forms. This streamlines the process of managing devices and clients, making it
         easier for users to navigate and manage their resources effectively.

The company also introduced RPA Pro and RPA Essentials, the ultimate solutions for IT professionals looking to
maximize efficiencies tailored to their specific business needs. With these powerful tools at your disposal, partners
gain access to a range of game-changing features, including:
    •    Partner-Created Custom Actions: Gives the ability to customize, design, and implement custom actions,
         providing a dynamic and personalized approach to workflow integration.
    •    Easily Integrated Third-Party Actions: Allows partners to integrate actions from external applications that
         support API access, enhancing interoperability and extending the capabilities of ConnectWise Workflow
         Orchestrator.

"We are steadfast in our commitment to advancing our Robotic Process Automation technology and AI capabilities,
empowering our partners to enhance productivity and provide exceptional service to their clients," stated Jeff
Bishop, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Unified Monitoring and Management at ConnectWise.
"By enabling our partners to automate daily tasks and operate more efficiently, MSPs can swiftly address talent
gaps while delivering innovative services that drive business growth for their clients."

ConnectWise is not only dedicated to enhancing its RPA capabilities, but is also prioritizing improving the user
experience (UX) for bots. As part of this initiative, bots are now categorized into distinct and well-defined categories,
such as User Management and PC Management. Additionally, ConnectWise has implemented visual differentiators,
utilizing icons to clearly distinguish between cloud, on-premises, and endpoint bots. These efforts aim to provide
users with a seamless and intuitive experience while interacting with bots.

“As MSPs continue to transition away from a distribution-driven world to one driven by marketplace subscriptions
and cloud platforms, we are besieged with an abundance of information as well as user requests,” said Rick Harber,
Founder & CEO of Decision Digital. “This problem can no longer be affordably solved with human horsepower.
Instead, we must invest in tools that go beyond scheduled or triggered scripts. We must evolve and leverage
workflows and robotic processes that automate these tasks with logic and intelligence. The introduction of
ConnectWise RPA and workflow signals their intent to again be the leaders of the next great transformation in
managed services. We are using them right now, and we are rewriting and streamlining processes as a result. And
we are just getting started.”

At Automation Nation 2024, the stage was set for an extraordinary showcase of innovation as ConnectWise
introduced an array of innovative features and functions. With an impressive lineup of 15-20 new options in
ConnectWise RPA, attendees were immersed in a realm of limitless possibilities. The event also offered a unique
virtual community experience through the hyperautomation subset, allowing participants to engage in interactive
activities like never before.
