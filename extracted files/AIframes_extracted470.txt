portfolio of ThreatDown endpoint security solutionsSANTA CLARA, Calif., April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --
Malwarebytes, a global leader in real-time cyber protection, announced a new integration withConnectWise, the
world's leading software company dedicated to the success of IT solution providers. The new integration gives

businesses do not have a full-time IT employee in-house. Of those that do have in-house IT, 63% have only two to
four staffers1. This makes many SMBs leery of complex integrations and dependent on the channel for their
cybersecurity needs. "MSPs on the front lines of cybersecurity everyday need streamlined, efficient solutions to
help them stay ahead of today's sophisticated threats," said Brian Thomas, SVP of Global Channels, Malwarebytes.
"We've purpose built ThreatDown solutions for MSPs to take down threats, including the latest ransomware,
