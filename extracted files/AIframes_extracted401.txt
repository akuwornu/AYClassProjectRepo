PR NewswireNEW YORK, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AttorneyJames F. HaggertyandEric W. Rose, a nationally
known expert on reputational damages, are pleased to announce the publication of a new white paper, "Navigating
Reputational Harm: A Deep Dive into Repairing, Measuring, Metrics, and Legal Implications of Reputational Harm
in the Internet Age," published byHart + Harvest Pressas part of their new Media Monograph Series.

 With a rise in false and defamatory content due to social media and the internet, managing a reputation has
become increasingly difficult, presenting challenges to the traditional reputational response methods. This white
paper features a comprehensive analysis on how to handle the growing challenges of repairing reputational
damage in a media-driven era.Haggerty and Rose provide a guide on the best practices moving forward to help
properly handle a reputational crisis online, along with addressing the more prominent role of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) in perpetuating reputational harm."Simply put," the authors, write, "in today's world, everyone is a publisher,
everyone has an opinion, this opinionated "news" can be transmitted globally with the touch of a button, and we all
have actual malice toward each other â€” or, at least, toward anyone with an opposing or adversarial
viewpoint."Haggerty and Rose add that "the difference between fact and opinion, which has traditionally been
critical to defamation cases, has also blurred. Indeed, this brave new world has changed, and will further change,
the framework and cost-benefit analysis surrounding modern defamation law. This will likely result in more
defamation suits and greater damages, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions."A guide for public
relations professionals, organizations, and legal professionals dealing with reputation issues online,Navigating
Reputational Harmoutlines various tools and techniques for addressing reputational damage, including social media
monitoring platforms and sentiment analysis tools.This white paper is available for download on the websites ofEKA
