American Oversight issued the following news:

Former President Trump has consistently sought to delay or evade accountability for his actions -- including his
effort to overturn the 2020 election.

In an effort to postpone trial in his federal election interference case until after this year's election, Trump's legal
team appealed a recent ruling that he is not entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution. But a brief filed by
American Oversight last week has -- as many legal observers and experts have noted -- the potential to derail that
delay tactic.

Late last month, we filed an amicus brief that argues that the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lacks jurisdiction
to hear Trump's immunity appeal until after he is tried by a jury, convicted, and sentenced.

* Supreme Court precedent prohibits a criminal defendant from immediately appealing an order denying immunity
unless the claim is based on "an explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee" that the defendant doesn't have to go
to trial.

* Trump's claims rest on no such explicit guarantee. And this week, in a reply brief that mentioned us, Trump still
failed to identify any provision that expressly immunizes him from facing trial.

* The case should be sent back to the trial court, the stay should be lifted, and the matter should immediately
proceed to trial.

* "This is a perfect example of the adage 'Justice delayed is justice denied,'" said American Oversight Executive
Director Heather Sawyer. "The American people should have the benefit of a jury verdict on Trump's guilt before
they choose the next president of the United States."

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 5
                  American Oversight: News Roundup - Why Trump's Trial Shouldn't Be Delayed

Oral arguments on the appeal are scheduled for this Tuesday, Jan. 9, and Trump will reportedly appear in court.
Earlier this week, the court ordered lawyers to be prepared to discuss amicus briefs filed in the case, bringing major
attention to our argument.

The timing is especially significant given that it's been three years since the violent and heavily armed mob of
Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

* State and federal prosecutors are continuing their effort to hold Trump and his allies accountable for their actions
that day: As of December, about 1,240 people had been arrested in connection to the attack, the New York Times
reported.

* But a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll has found that today, "Republicans are more
sympathetic to those who stormed the U.S. Capitol and more likely to absolve Donald Trump of responsibility for the
attack than they were in 2021."

* State officials continue to weigh the question of whether Trump should be allowed on the 2024 ballot because of
his role in the insurrection. Last week, Maine joined Colorado in finding Trump ineligible for the state's primary
ballot, while officials in California and Michigan recently decided that Trump may appear.

* On Wednesday, Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ruling barring him from appearing on the
Colorado ballot.

On the Records

Foreign and Taxpayer Spending at Trump's Properties

A new report released by the House Oversight Committee shows that Trump's businesses received at least $7.8
million from officials and governments of 20 countries during his presidency. The report confirms what we've long
known: Trump's businesses got a huge boost from his time in office.

Our investigations uncovered numerous examples of taxpayer money going to his private businesses:

* Last year, we obtained records showing that the Defense Department spent nearly $1 million at Trump properties
between July 2017 and November 2019, including more than $270,000 at Trump National Doral Miami.

* In 2021, we obtained records from the Pentagon detailing a number of trips taken by cabinet and White House
officials on military airplanes during the first year of the Trump administration, including several visits to Trump's
Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

* Justice Department officials spent more than $5,700 at Trump's Doral and Soho properties in 2018, according to
records we uncovered.

* DHS and Pentagon employees spent more than $5,500 at Trump properties between 2017 and early 2019,
including a roughly $1,600 dinner that DHS official Miles Taylor had with a foreign government representative at a
restaurant at the Trump International Hotel.

* "Is this a meeting I should attend?" Trump's ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft asked a staffer in a November
2018 email we obtained. "If so, I would prefer the TRUMP HOTEL."

* Woody Johnson, Trump's billionaire ambassador to the U.K., paid pound sterling1,143 (about $1,500) for a single
day of activities at Trump's golf course in Scotland in July 2018.

Three Years Since Jan. 6

The evidence uncovered over the past three years has shown that the storming of the Capitol was a culmination of
Trump and his closest allies' larger scheme to cling to power. Here are some of our major findings about the effort
to overturn his election loss.

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 5

* We obtained DOJ call logs, Secret Service timelines, and more records that shed light on the events of Jan. 6 and
the surrounding days, and the government's response. We created a detailed and comprehensive timeline of that
day and related public records.

* Trump Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark was willing to bolster Trump's baseless claims of widespread voter
fraud and to help him use the DOJ to overturn the election. We obtained emails Clark sent in the final days of the
administration -- including an email to the acting attorney general alluding to his actions as something on which
"reasonable minds can differ."

* We uncovered whistleblower complaints from the Department of Defense's Office of the Inspector General in
which federal employees reported coworkers they believed participated in the insurrection and preceding rallies.

* Through litigation, we discovered that the Defense Department and the Army had wiped the phones of top officials
at the end of the Trump administration -- including texts from Jan. 6, 2021. In response, the Pentagon announced a
new policy regarding preserving texts.

* Trump and some of his associates are facing multiple criminal charges related to their election interference. We
compiled a guide to public records we've obtained that shed light on the activities and communications of Trump's
co-conspirators and co-defendants, including Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Jeffrey Clark, Mark
Meadows, and more.
