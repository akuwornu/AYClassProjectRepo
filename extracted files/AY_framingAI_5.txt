MONCTON, New Brunswick, Sept. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Major Drilling Group International Inc.
(“Major Drilling” or the “Company”) (TSX: MDI), a leading provider of specialized drilling services to the mining
sector, today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, ended July 31, 2024.

Quarterly Highlights:
    •     Revenue of $190.0 million, an increase of 13.1% from revenue reported in Q4 of fiscal 2024, down 4.5%
          compared to the same period last year.
    •     Revenue from seniors and intermediates up 7% year-over-year, while junior funding remains limited.
    •     EBITDA(1) of $34.3 million (or $0.42 per share), down from $40.3 million for the same period last year.
    •     Net earnings of $15.9 million (or $0.19 per share), down from $21.8 million (or $0.26 per share) for the
          same period last year.
    •     $15 million strategic investment in technology to provide AI digital core logging and drillside orebody
          intelligence.
    •     Industry leading net cash(1) of $76.9 million, after strategic investment.

“For Q1 fiscal 2025, Major Drilling’s globally diversified operations ensured that we were able to increase our
revenue over the previous quarter and maintain a solid level of activity, despite the continued market slowdown in
junior financing and a dip in overall global drilling activity this quarter,” commented Mr. Denis Larocque, President &
CEO of Major Drilling. “We were particularly pleased with the results from our Australasian and Chilean operations,
which helped offset a slowdown in North America driven by the lack of junior financing.”

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 15

“The Company delivered solid financial results in the quarter, generating $34.3 million in EBITDA bolstered by
strong performance in Australasia,” commented Ian Ross, CFO of Major Drilling. “During the quarter, we were
pleased to announce that our 2021 McKay acquisition successfully met all of the EBITDA milestones in their
earnout period, and the final contingent payment will be made in Q2. This acquisition has provided tremendous
stability in our Australasian region and we are pleased to see them achieve the full earnout. In anticipation of
increased activity levels, we continued to modernize our drill fleet, spending $21.3 million in capex, including 7 new
drills and support equipment. This enables us to field more rigs into the busiest markets, while disposing of 4 older,
less efficient rigs, bringing Major Drilling’s total fleet count to 609 drills. The Company also made a $15 million
strategic investment in DGI Geoscience Inc./KORE GeoSystems Inc. as we look to evolve our industry-leading
specialized services by offering valuable incremental downhole data to our customers,” concluded Mr. Ross.

“I am thrilled about our new partnership, which positions Major Drilling at the forefront of technological
advancements in the drilling industry,” said Mr. Larocque. “The value of this transaction lies in integrating geological
solutions, including AI, with our specialized drilling services, creating a unique offering that incorporates the latest
advanced technology. This move continues our progression in drilling innovation and aligns with our growth strategy
as we invest in the future of mining. We believe that combining these services, including our Rock5 technology, will
solidify our position as the preferred contractor for mining companies.”

“As we enter the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we anticipate a slight decline in our revenue run rate relative to our
first quarter, primarily due to subdued activity levels in North America. Market conditions, particularly for juniors,
remain challenging, with a continued lack of funding translating to decreased activity levels. However, the recent
strengthening of gold and copper prices has shown signs of improved financing and investor sentiment.”

“The significant improvement in gold prices has bolstered the financial positions of most senior mining companies.
This financial boost is likely to lead to increased exploration budgets over time, given a decade-long decline in gold
reserves. Recent improvements in copper pricing and demand, that build on already strong levels, are expected to
drive additional exploration efforts.”

“Further, as global demand for electrification continues to rise, the need for vast quantities of copper and battery
metals will intensify around the world, putting pressure on the current supply and demand dynamics. We anticipate
this will result in significant additional funds flowing into copper and other base metal exploration projects to meet
the pending deficit. Our goal is to assist our customers in discovering the metals essential for advancing a green
economy. Many of these new mineral deposits are in challenging-to-access areas, necessitating complex drilling
solutions, thus sustaining the demand for Major Drilling’s specialized services."

“Major Drilling is uniquely positioned to respond to, and benefit from, these market dynamics. Supported by our
strong financial position, successful recruitment and training efforts, and technological advancements, we continue
to be the operator and employer of choice in our industry,” concluded Mr. Larocque.

First Quarter Ended July 31, 2024

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 15

Total revenue for the quarter was $190.0 million, down 4.5% from revenue of $198.9 million recorded in the same
quarter last year. The favourable foreign exchange translation impact, when comparing to the effective rates for the
previous year, was approximately $1 million on revenue, with minimal impact on net earnings as expenditures in
foreign jurisdictions tend to be in the same currency as revenue.

Revenue for the quarter from Canada - U.S. drilling operations decreased by 14.1% to $87.2 million, compared to
the same period last year. Drilling activity has been reduced as lack of junior financing continues to impact this
region. South and Central American revenue decreased by 3.5% to $49.8 million for the quarter, compared to the
same quarter last year. The region saw growth in Chile, driven by copper exploration, but was offset by seasonal
slowdowns and project delays in other countries.

Australasian and African revenue increased by 15.9% to $53.1 million, compared to the same period last year.
Demand for specialized services in Australia and Mongolia has driven the growth in the quarter.

Gross margin percentage for the quarter was 22.1%, compared to 24.6% for the same period last year.
Depreciation expense totaling $12.9 million is included in direct costs for the current quarter, versus $11.0 million in
the same quarter last year. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes depreciation expense, was 28.9% for the
quarter, compared to 30.1% for the same period last year. Margins are down slightly from the prior year due to a
more competitive environment in Canada - U.S.

General and administrative costs were $18.5 million, an increase of $2.0 million compared to the same quarter last
year. The increase from the prior year was driven by annual wage adjustments implemented at the start of the fiscal
year and increased non-recurring professional fees related to strategic corporate initiatives.

Foreign exchange loss was $0.8 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million for the same quarter last year. While the
Company's reporting currency is the Canadian dollar, various jurisdictions have net monetary assets or liabilities
exposed to various other currencies.

The income tax provision for the quarter was an expense of $4.9 million, compared to an expense of $7.2 million for
the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year was driven by reduced profitability.

Net earnings were $15.9 million or $0.19 per share ($0.19 per share diluted) for the quarter, compared to net
earnings of $21.8 million or $0.26 per share ($0.26 per share diluted) for the prior year quarter.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

The Company’s financial data has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, with the exception of certain financial
measures detailed below. The measures below have been used consistently by the Company’s management team
in assessing operational performance on both segmented and consolidated levels, and in assessing the Company’s
financial strength. The Company believes these non-IFRS financial measures are key, for both management and
investors, in evaluating performance at a consolidated level and are commonly reported and widely used by
investors and lending institutions as indicators of a company’s operating performance and ability to incur and
service debt, and as a valuation metric. These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS
and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies and
should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.

MAJOR DRILLING GROUP INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED July 31, 2024 AND 2023 (UNAUDITED)(in
thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share information)

1.     NATURE OF ACTIVITIES

Major Drilling Group International Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations
Act and has its head office at 111 St. George Street, Moncton, NB, Canada. The Company’s common shares are

                                                                                                        Page 10 of 15
                                 Major Drilling Announces First Quarter 2025 Results

listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”). The principal source of revenue consists of contract drilling for
companies primarily involved in mining and mineral exploration. The Company has operations in Canada, the
United States, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

2.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Statement of complianceThese Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (“IASB”) and using the accounting policies as outlined in the Company’s annual Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended April 30, 2024.

On September 4, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the financial statements for issue.

Basis of consolidationThese Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Company is
exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the investee.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation, where appropriate.

Basis of preparationThese Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared based on
the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value, using the same
accounting policies and methods of computation, with the exception of those detailed in note 4 below, as presented
in the Company’s annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended April 30, 2024.

3.       APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED IFRS

The Company has not applied the following IASB standard amendment that has been issued, but is not yet
effective:
     •    IAS 21 (as amended in 2023) - The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates - effective for periods
          beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with earlier application permitted. The amendments contain
          guidance to specify when a currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is
          not.

The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of the above amendment will have
on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

4.       MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

With the exception of the policy detailed below, all accounting policies and methods of computation remain the
same as those presented in the Company's annual Consolidation Financial Statements for the year ended April 30,
2024.

Investment in associateAssociates are companies that the Company has significant influence over and are
accounted for under the equity method. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. Significant influence
is presumed when the Company has an ownership interest greater than 20%, unless certain qualitative factors
overcome this assumption. In assessing significant influence and the ownership interest, potential voting or other
rights that are currently exercisable are taken into consideration.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost, inclusive
of transaction costs. The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's share of

                                                                                                        Page 11 of 15
                                 Major Drilling Announces First Quarter 2025 Results

the income or loss and equity movement of equity accounted associates. The Company does not recognize losses
exceeding the carrying value of its interest in the associate.

5.     KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources, which affect the application of
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period
of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods. Significant areas requiring
the use of management estimates relate to the useful lives of property, plant and equipment for depreciation
purposes, inventory valuation, determination of income and other taxes, recoverability of deferred income tax
assets, assumptions used in compilation of share-based payments, provisions, contingent considerations,
impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets and long-lived assets.

The Company applied judgment in determining the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries, the
determination of cash-generating units (“CGUs”), the degree of componentization of property, plant and equipment,
the recognition of provisions, the determination of the probability that deferred income tax assets will be realized
from future taxable earnings, and the determination of whether the Company exerts significant influence with
respect to its investment in associate under the equity accounting method.

6.     SEASONALITY OF OPERATIONS

The third quarter (November to January) is normally the Company’s weakest quarter due to the shutdown of mining
and exploration activities, often for extended periods over the holiday season.

7.     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Capital expenditures for the three months ended July 31, 2024 were $21,251 (2023- $16,274). The Company did
not obtain direct financing for the three months ended July 31, 2024 or 2023.

8.     INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATE

On July 22, 2024, the Company purchased shares in DGI Geoscience Inc. (“DGI”) for $15,000 in cash
consideration, a 39.8% equity interest (that provides the Company with 42.3% of the voting rights). DGI and its
subsidiaries are privately held entities, headquartered in Canada, focused on downhole survey and imaging
services as well as using artificial intelligence for logging scanned rock samples.

In addition to the equity interest, Major Drilling's representation on the DGI Board of Directors gives the Company
significant influence over DGI. While there are special approval rights granted to the Company as part of the
investment, these are more protective in nature and therefore, would not result in control, or joint control of DGI. As
a result, the Company concluded that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for its investment in DGI.

The Company incurred costs of $205 for this investment, relating to external legal fees and due diligence costs.
These amounts have been recorded as part of the cost of the investment in associate in the Interim Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As this transaction occurred late in the current quarter, the Company is in the process of finalizing the valuation of
assets related to this investment. The Company is within the initial measurement period and any changes to
provisional amounts will be reflected in future financial statements.

9.     SHARE BUYBACK

                                                                                                           Page 12 of 15
                                  Major Drilling Announces First Quarter 2025 Results

under its Normal Course Issuer Bid.

The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based upon the
latest information available. For those matters where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the Company
records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges. Inherent uncertainties exist in
estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax laws. While management believes they have adequately
provided for the probable outcome of these matters, future results may include favourable or unfavourable
adjustments to these estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made, or resolved, or when the
statutes of limitations lapse.

12.      EARNINGS PER SHARE

All of the Company’s earnings are attributable to common shares, therefore, net earnings are used in determining
earnings per share.

14.        FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair valueThe carrying values of cash, trade and other receivables, demand credit facilities and trade and other
payables approximate their fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity of the instruments. The carrying
value of contingent consideration and long-term debt approximates their fair value as the interest applicable is
reflective of fair market rates.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
      •    Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
      •    Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities,
           either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and
      •    Level 3 - inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
           inputs).

The Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, comprised
of share-price forward contracts with a combined notional amount of $8,654, maturing at varying dates through
June 2027.

The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market inputs whenever such inputs exist. A financial
instrument is classified to the lowest level of the hierarchy for which a significant input has been considered in
measuring fair value.

The Company’s derivatives, with fair values as follows, are classified as level 2 financial instruments and recorded
in trade and other receivables (payables) in the Interim Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no
transfers of amounts between level 1, level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the three months ended July 31,
2024.
