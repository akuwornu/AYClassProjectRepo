PR NewswireIn the news release, Kraus Hamdani Aerospace Wins Contract to Provide the U.S. Navy with Its First
Electric VTOL Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), issued April 4, 2024 by Kraus Hamdani Aerospace over PR
Newswire, we are advised by a representative for the company that there have been significant updates to the
entire press release. The complete, corrected release follows:Kraus Hamdani Aerospace Wins Contract to Provide
the U.S. Navy with its First Solar-electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)U.S.
Navy procures first-of-its-kind 100% solar-electric, Group 2 UAS from Kraus Hamdani Aerospace; the K1000ULE
VTOL UASEMERYVILLE, Calif., April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Navy PMA 263 has selected Kraus
Hamdani Aerospace to provide the K1000ULE solar-electric VTOL UAS. It will be fielded by the United States
Marine Corps Small Unit Remote Scouting System. The Navy ultimately selected the K1000ULE through a
comprehensive down selection evaluation process.Conducted at a government test facility and overseen by the
University of Maryland UAS Research and Operations Center, the following capabilities were evaluated:

Enhanced maneuverability, enabling operations from disadvantaged locationsReduced transportation and logistics
enabling rapid transportation into theaterMinimized crew requirements with a maximum of two operators (pilot and
sensor operator)Silent operations to minimize detectionAirborne endurance (extended flight time). The K1000ULE
remains a world leader in long-endurance aerial operationsVTOL capabilities, ensuring independence from
traditional runwaysDurability, with the ability to operate in various environmental conditionsDay and night operations
and     sensor      capabilitiesIntelligence,   Surveillance    and    Reconnaissance      with    Target    Acquisition
capabilitiesCompliance with the SOCOM Modular Payload (MOD Payload) standardCommand and Control (C2)
range between operator and aircraftMission systems include simplified Command and Control of the K1000ULE,
Full-Motion Video (FMV) interfaces, and Target Acquisition capabilitiesOnce in the hands of the U.S. Marine Corps.,
the attributes above will enhance the Navy's capacity to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
operations simpler, faster, and more cost-effective with the ultimate objective of saving lives. Additionally, the Navy
will get enhanced long-range communication capabilities enabling continued coverage in denied and contested
environments.World-leading hardware. Game-changing software.The K1000ULE, while providing the longest
endurance in the electric Group-2 VTOL category, is enabled to share critical data between platforms within its
network. This allows for the repositioning of aircraft on-demand based on sensor input while dynamically populating
the Common Operating Picture.A single operator can control a swarm of K1000ULE UAS through a simple user
interface, identifying specific coverage areas and launching the correct number of aircraft to fulfill dynamic missions.
The pilot has full situational awareness and can dynamically re-task aircraft in real-time as mission objectives
change using gamified user interfaces.About Kraus Hamdani AerospaceKraus Hamdani Aerospace is the world

leader in building Ultra-Long Endurance (ULE) Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) that mimic nature by utilizing
onboard artificial intelligence to silently glide through the air like a bird and generate clean onboard energy. The
K1000ULE is the world's longest endurance fully electric zero emissions autonomous unmanned aircraft in its size
and weight category. The K1000ULE comprises aerial-based data, ISR, and communication services enabled by
multi-drone coordination systems (coordinated swarming). This addresses critical customer needs within various
sectors, such as emergency and disaster relief, data and telecommunications, defense, agriculture, oil and gas,
climate change, and wildlife preservation.Contact:
