Summary

China's military modernization effort, including its naval modernization effort, is the top focus of U.S. defense
planning and budgeting. China's naval modernization effort has been underway for about 30 years, since the early
to mid-1990s, and has transformed China's navy into a much more modern and capable force. China's navy is a
formidable military force within China's near-seas region, and it is conducting a growing number of operations in the
broader waters of the Western Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and waters around Europe.

China's navy is, by far, the largest of any country in East Asia, and sometime between 2015 and 2020 it surpassed
the U.S. Navy in numbers of battle force ships. DOD states that China's navy "is the largest navy in the world with a
battle force of over 370 platforms, including major surface combatants, submarines, ocean-going amphibious ships,
mine warfare ships, aircraft carriers, and fleet auxiliaries. Notably, this figure does not include approximately 60
HOUBEI-class patrol combatants that carry anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM). The... overall battle force [of China's
navy] is expected to grow to 395 ships by 2025 and 435 ships by 2030." The U.S. Navy, by comparison, included
291 battle force ships as of October 19, 2023, and the Navy's FY2024 budget submission projects that the Navy will
include 290 battle force ships by the end of FY2030. U.S. military officials and other observers are expressing
concern or alarm regarding the pace of China's naval shipbuilding effort, the capacity of China's shipbuilding

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 16

industry compared with the capacity of the U.S. shipbuilding industry, and resulting trend lines regarding the relative
sizes and capabilities of China's navy and the U.S. Navy.

China's naval modernization effort encompasses a wide array of ship, aircraft, weapon, and C4ISR (command and
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) acquisition programs, as well
as improvements in logistics, doctrine, personnel quality, education and training, and exercises. China's navy
currently has certain limitations and weaknesses, which it is working to overcome.

China's military modernization effort, including its naval modernization effort, is assessed as being aimed at
developing capabilities for, among other things, addressing the situation with Taiwan militarily, if need be; achieving
a greater degree of control or domination over China's near-seas region, particularly the South China Sea;
defending China's commercial sea lines of communication (SLOCs), particularly those linking China to the Persian
Gulf; displacing U.S. influence in the Western Pacific; and asserting China's status as the leading regional power
and a major world power. Observers believe China wants its navy to be capable of acting as part of an anti-
access/area-denial (A2/AD) force - a force that can deter U.S. intervention in a conflict in China's near-seas region
over Taiwan or some other issue, or failing that, delay the arrival or reduce the effectiveness of intervening U.S.
forces.

The U.S. Navy has taken a number of actions to counter China's naval modernization effort. Among other things,
the U.S. Navy has shifted a greater percentage of its fleet to the Pacific; assigned its most-capable new ships and
aircraft to the Pacific; maintained or increased general presence operations, training and developmental exercises,
and engagement and cooperation with allied and other navies in the Indo-Pacific; increased the planned future size
of the Navy; initiated, increased, or accelerated numerous programs for developing new military technologies and
acquiring new ships, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and weapons; developed new operational concepts for
countering Chinese maritime A2/AD forces; and signaled that the Navy in coming years will shift to a more-
distributed fleet architecture that will feature a substantially greater use of unmanned vehicles. The issue for
Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Biden Administration's proposed U.S. Navy plans, budgets,
and programs for responding to China's naval modernization effort.

Introduction

Issue for Congress

This report provides background information and issues for Congress on China's naval modernization effort and its
implications for U.S. Navy capabilities. China's military modernization effort, including its naval modernization effort,
is the top focus of U.S. defense planning and budgeting./1

The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Biden Administration's proposed U.S. Navy
plans, budgets, and programs for responding to China's naval modernization effort. Congress's decisions on this
issue could affect U.S. Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the U.S. defense industrial base.

Sources and Terminology

This report is based on unclassified open-source information, such as the annual Department of Defense (DOD)
report to Congress on military and security developments involving China,/2 a 2019 Defense Intelligence Agency
(DIA) report on China's military power,/3 a 2015 Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) report on China's navy,/4
published reference sources such as IHS Jane's Fighting Ships,/5 and press reports.

For convenience, this report uses the term China's naval modernization effort to refer to the modernization not only
of China's navy, but also of Chinese military forces outside China's navy that can be used to counter U.S. naval
forces operating in the Western Pacific, such as land-based anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), land-based
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), land-based Air Force aircraft armed with anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), and
land-based long-range radars for detecting and tracking ships at sea.

China's military is formally called the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Its navy is called the PLA Navy, or PLAN
(also abbreviated as PLA[N]), and its air force is called the PLA Air Force, or PLAAF. The PLA Navy includes an air
component that is called the PLA Naval Air Force, or PLANAF. China refers to its ballistic missile force as the PLA
Rocket Force (PLARF).

This report uses the term China's near-seas region to refer to the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China
Sea - the waters enclosed by the so-called first island chain. The so-called second island chain encloses both these
waters and the Philippine Sea that is situated between the Philippines and Guam./6

Background

Brief Overview of China's Naval Modernization Effort

Key overview points concerning China's naval modernization effort include the following:

* China's naval modernization effort, which forms part of a broader Chinese military modernization effort that
includes several additional areas of emphasis,/7 has been underway for about 30 years, since the early to mid-
1990s, and has transformed China's navy into a much more modern and capable force.

* China's navy is a formidable military force within China's near-seas region, and it is conducting a growing number
of operations in more-distant waters, including the broader waters of the Western Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and
waters around Europe.

* China's navy is, by far, the largest of any country in East Asia, and as shown in Table 2, sometime between 2015
and 2020, China's navy surpassed the U.S. Navy in numbers of battle force ships (meaning the types of ships that
count toward the quoted size of the U.S. Navy), making China's navy the numerically largest in the world. DOD
states: "The PLAN is the largest navy in the world with a battle force of over 370 platforms, including major surface
combatants, submarines, ocean-going amphibious ships, mine warfare ships, aircraft carriers, and fleet auxiliaries.
Notably, this figure does not include approximately 60 HOUBEI-class patrol combatants that carry anti-ship cruise
missiles (ASCM). The PLAN's overall battle force is expected to grow to 395 ships by 2025 and 435 ships by 2030.
Much of this growth will be in major surface combatants."/8 The U.S. Navy, by comparison, included 291 battle
force ships as of October 19, 2023, and the Navy's FY2024 budget submission projects that the Navy will include
290 battle force ships by the end of FY2030./9

* U.S. military officials and other observers are expressing concern or alarm regarding the pace of China's naval
shipbuilding effort, the capacity of China's shipbuilding industry compared with the capacity of the U.S. shipbuilding
industry, and resulting trend lines regarding the relative sizes and capabilities of China's navy and the U.S.
Navy./10 China's navy is viewed as posing a major challenge to the U.S. Navy's ability to achieve and maintain
wartime control of blue-water ocean areas in the Western Pacific - the first such challenge the U.S. Navy has faced
since the end of the Cold War. China's navy forms a key element of a Chinese challenge to the long-standing status
of the United States as the leading military power in the Western Pacific.

7 Other areas of emphasis in China's military modernization effort include space capabilities, cyber and electronic
warfare capabilities, ballistic missile forces, and aviation forces, as well as the development of emerging military-
applicable technologies such as hypersonics, artificial intelligence, robotics and unmanned vehicles, directed-
energy technologies, and quantum technologies. For more on China's military modernization effort in general, see
CRS Report R46808, China's Military: The People's Liberation Army (PLA), by Caitlin Campbell. For a discussion of
advanced military technologies, see CRS In Focus IF11105, Defense Primer: Emerging Technologies, by Kelley M.
Sayler. U.S.-China competition in military capabilities in turn forms one dimension of a broader U.S.-China strategic
competition that also includes political, diplomatic, economic, technological, and ideological dimensions.

* China's naval ships, aircraft, and weapons are much more modern and capable than they were at the start of the
1990s, and are comparable in many respects to those of Western navies. DOD states: "Today, the PLAN is largely
composed of modern multi-role platforms featuring advanced anti-ship, anti-air, and antisubmarine weapons and
sensors."/11 ONI states that "Chinese naval ship design and material quality is in many cases comparable to [that
of] USN [U.S. Navy] ships, and China is quickly closing the gap in any areas of deficiency."/12

* China's naval modernization effort encompasses a wide array of platform and weapon acquisition programs,
including anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), submarines, surface ships, aircraft,
unmanned vehicles (UVs),/13 and supporting C4ISR (command and control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) systems. China's naval modernization effort also includes
improvements in logistics, doctrine, personnel quality, education and training, and exercises./14

* China's military modernization effort, including its naval modernization effort, is assessed as being aimed at
developing capabilities for, among other things, addressing the situation with Taiwan militarily, if need be; achieving
a greater degree of control or domination over China's near-seas region, particularly the South China Sea;
enforcing China's view that it has the right to regulate foreign military activities in its 200-mile maritime exclusive
economic zone (EEZ);/15 defending China's commercial sea lines of communication (SLOCs), particularly those
linking China to the Persian Gulf; displacing U.S. influence in the Western Pacific; and asserting China's status as
the leading regional power and a major world power./16 Additional missions for China's navy include conducting
maritime security (including antipiracy) operations, evacuating Chinese nationals from foreign countries when
necessary, and conducting humanitarian assistance/disaster response (HA/DR) operations.

* Observers believe China wants its navy to be capable of acting as part of an anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD)
force - a force that can deter U.S. intervention in a conflict in China's near-seas region over Taiwan or some other
issue, or failing that, delay the arrival or reduce the effectiveness of intervening U.S. forces.

* The planned ultimate size and composition of China's navy is not publicly known. In contrast to the U.S. Navy,
China does not release a navy force-level goal or detailed information about planned ship procurement rates,
planned total ship procurement quantities, planned ship retirements, and resulting projected force levels.

* Although China's naval modernization effort has substantially improved China's naval capabilities, China's navy
currently is assessed as having limitations or weaknesses in certain areas,/17 including joint operations with other
parts of China's military,/18 anti-submarine warfare (ASW), long-range targeting, a limited capacity for carrying out
at-sea resupply of combatant ships operating far from home waters,/19 a limited number of overseas bases and
support facilities,/20 a need to train large numbers of personnel to crew its new ships,/21 non-commissioned
officers (NCOs) that are not empowered by unit commanders through mission command to achieve a commander's
intent,/22 and a lack of recent combat experience./23 China is working to reduce or overcome such limitations and
weaknesses.24 Although China's navy has limitations and weaknesses, it may nevertheless be sufficient for
performing missions of interest to Chinese leaders. As China's navy reduces its weaknesses and limitations, it may
become sufficient to perform a wider array of potential missions.

The use of a dual command structure in the crews of larger Chinese ships, involving both a commanding officer and
a political officer, has been raised as a source of potential reduced command effectiveness in certain tactical
situations. See Mallory Shelbourne, "At-Sea Political Officers Could Pose Problems for Chinese Navy in War,

Some observers argue that corruption in China's shipbuilding companies may be a source of weaknesses in
China's naval modernization effort. See, for example, Zi Yang, "The Invisible Threat to China's Navy: Corruption,"
Diplomat, May 19, 2020. See also Bloomberg News, "China's Military Probes Slew of Graft Issues Going Back to
2017," Bloomberg, July 26, 2023; Gordan G. Chang, "China's Military Is Nowhere Near as Strong as the CCP

Graft," Asia Times, June 26, 2020.

24 For example, China's naval shipbuilding programs were previously dependent on foreign suppliers for some ship
components. ONI, however, states that "almost all weapons and sensors on Chinese naval ships are produced in-
country, and China no longer relies on Russia or other countries for any significant naval ship systems." (Source:

The PLAN is also improving its anti-submarine warfare capabilities through the development of its surface
combatants and special mission aircraft, but it continues to lack a robust deep-water antisubmarine warfare (ASW)
capability. (2023 DOD CMSD, p. 56.)

* In addition to modernizing its navy, China has substantially increased the size and capabilities of its coast guard.
DOD states that China's coast guard is "the largest maritime law enforcement fleet in the world."/25 China also
operates sizeable maritime militia that includes a large number of fishing vessels. China relies primarily on its
maritime militia and coast guard to assert and defend its maritime claims in its near-seas region, with the navy
operating over the horizon as a potential backup force./26

Numbers of Ships; Comparisons to U.S. Navy

Overview

DOD states: "The PLAN is the largest navy in the world with a battle force of over 370 platforms, including major
surface combatants, submarines, ocean-going amphibious ships, mine warfare ships, aircraft carriers, and fleet
auxiliaries. Notably, this figure does not include approximately 60 HOUBEI-class patrol combatants that carry anti-
ship cruise missiles (ASCM). The PLAN's overall battle force is expected to grow to 395 ships by 2025 and 435
ships by 2030. Much of this growth will be in major surface combatants./27 DIA states that "the PLAN is rapidly
retiring older, single-mission warships in favor of larger, multi-mission ships equipped with advanced antiship,
antiair, and antisubmarine weapons and sensors and C2 [command and control] facilities."/28

Ultimate Size and Composition of China's Navy Not Publicly Known

The planned ultimate size and composition of China's navy is not publicly known. The U.S. Navy makes public its
force-level goal and regularly releases a 30-year shipbuilding plan that shows planned procurements of new ships,
planned retirements of existing ships, and resulting projected force levels, as well as a five-year shipbuilding plan
that shows, in greater detail, the first five years of the 30-year shipbuilding plan./29 In contrast, China does not
release a navy force-level goal or detailed information about planned ship procurement rates, planned total ship
procurement quantities, planned ship retirements, or resulting projected force levels. The ultimate size and
composition of China's navy might be an unsettled and evolving issue among Chinese military and political leaders.
One observer states that "it seems the majority of past foreign projections of Chinese military and Chinese navy
procurement scale and speed have been underestimates... All military forces have a desired force requirement and
a desired 'critical mass' to aspire toward. Whether the Chinese navy is close to its desired force or not, is of no
small consequence."/30

***

25 DOD states that

The CCG's [China Coast Guard's] continued expansion and modernization makes it the largest maritime law
enforcement fleet in the world. Newer CCG vessels are larger and more capable than older vessels, allowing them
to operate further offshore and remain on station longer. While exact numbers are unavailable, open-source
reporting and commercial imagery counts indicate the CCG has over 150 regional and oceangoing patrol vessels
(more than 1,000 tons). These larger vessels include over 20 corvettes transferred from the PLAN, which were
modified for CCG operations. , The newer, larger CCG vessels are equipped with helicopter facilities, high-capacity
water cannons, multiple interceptor boats and guns ranging from 20 to 76 millimeters., Revised estimates indicate

                                                                                                 Page 11 of 16

the CCG operates more than 50 regional patrol combatants (more than 500 tons), which can be used for limited
offshore operations, and an additional 300 coastal patrol craft (100 to 499 tons).

Number of Ships Is a One-Dimensional Measure, but Trends in Numbers Can Be of Value Analytically

Relative U.S. and Chinese naval capabilities are sometimes assessed by showing comparative numbers of U.S.
and Chinese ships. Although the total number of ships in a navy (or a navy's aggregate tonnage) is relatively easy
to calculate, it is a one-dimensional measure that leaves out numerous other factors that bear on a navy's
capabilities and how those capabilities compare to its assigned missions. As a result, as discussed in further detail
in Appendix A, comparisons of the total numbers of ships in China's navy and the U.S. Navy are highly problematic
as a means of assessing relative U.S. and Chinese naval capabilities and how those capabilities compare to the
missions assigned to the two navies. At the same time, however, an examination of trends over time in these
relative numbers of ships can shed some light on how the relative balance of U.S. and Chinese naval capabilities
might be changing over time.

Three Tables Showing Numbers of Chinese and U.S. Navy Ships

Table Showing Figures from Annual DOD Reports

Table 1 shows numbers of certain types of Chinese navy ships - those that might be thought of as the principal
combat ships of China's navy - from 2005 to the present, along with the number of China coast guard ships from
2017 to the present, as presented in DOD's annual reports on military and security developments involving China.
As can be seen in Table 1, most types of Chinese navy ships shown in the table have increased numerically since
2005.

As can be seen in Table 1, about 53% of the increase since 2005 in the total number of Chinese navy ships shown
in the table (a net increase of 59 ships out of a total net increase of 112 ships) resulted from increases in missile-
armed fast patrol craft starting in 2009 (a net increase of 9 ships) and corvettes starting in 2014 (50 ships). These
are the smallest surface combatants shown in the table. The 50-ship increase in corvettes is due to the Jingdao
(Type 056) corvette program discussed later in this report. ONI states that "a significant portion of China's Battle
Force consists of the large number of new corvettes and guided-missile frigates recently built for the PLAN."/31 As
can also be seen in the table, most of the remaining increase since 2005 in the number of Chinese navy ships
shown in the table is accounted for by increases in cruisers and destroyers (29 ships) and amphibious ships (17
ships).

Table 1 lumps together less capable older Chinese ships with more capable modern Chinese ships. In examining
the numbers in the table, it can be helpful to keep in mind that for many of the types of Chinese ships shown in the

                                                                                                 Page 12 of 16
      Congressional Research Service : 'China Naval Modernization - Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities -
                               Background & Issues for Congress ' (Part 1 of 3)

table, the percentage of the ships accounted for by more capable modern designs was growing over time, even if
the total number of ships for those types was changing little.

For reference, Table 1 also shows the total number of ships in the U.S. Navy (known technically as the total number
of battle force ships), and compares it to the total number of the types of Chinese ships that are shown in the
table./32 The result is an apples-vs.-oranges comparison, because the Chinese figures exclude certain ship types,
such as auxiliary and support ships, while the U.S. Navy figure includes auxiliary and support ships but excludes
patrol craft. Changes over time in this apples-vs.-oranges comparison, however, can be of value in understanding
trends in the comparative sizes of the U.S. and Chinese navies.

On the basis of the figures in Table 1, it might be said that in 2015, the total number of principal combat ships in
China's navy surpassed the total number of U.S. Navy battle force ships (a figure that includes not only the U.S.
Navy's principal combat ships, but also other U.S. Navy ships, such as auxiliary and support ships). It is important,
however, to keep in mind the differences in composition between the two navies. The U.S. Navy, for example, has
many more aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, and cruisers and destroyers, while China's navy has
many more diesel attack submarines, frigates, and corvettes.

Table Showing ONI Figures from February 2020

Table 2 shows comparative numbers of Chinese and U.S. battle force ships (and figures for certain types of ships
that contribute toward China's total number of battle force ships) from 2000 to 2030, with the figures for 2025 and
2030 being projections. The figures for China's ships are taken from an ONI information paper of February 2020.
Battle force ships are the types of ships that count toward the quoted size of the U.S. Navy. For China, the total
number of battle force ships shown excludes the missile-armed coastal patrol craft shown in Table 1, but includes
auxiliary and support ships that are not shown in Table 1. Compared to Table 1, the figures in Table 2 come closer
to providing an apples-to-apples comparison of the two navies' numbers of ships, although it could be argued that
China's missile-armed coastal patrol craft can be a significant factor for operations within the first island chain.

As shown in Table 2, China's navy surpassed the U.S. Navy in terms of total number of battle force ships sometime
between 2015 and 2020. As mentioned earlier in connection with Table 1, however, it is important to keep in mind
the differences in composition between the two navies. The U.S. Navy, for example, currently has many more
aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, and cruisers and destroyers, while China's navy currently has many
more diesel attack submarines, frigates, and corvettes.

Table Showing U.S. Navy Figures from October 2020

Table 3 shows numbers of certain types of Chinese navy ships in 2020, and projections of those numbers for 2025,
2030, and 2040, along with the total number of U.S. Navy battle force ships in 2020, and projections of those
numbers for 2025, 2030, and 2040. The figures for China's ships were provided by the Navy at the request of CRS.
As with Table 1, the result is an apples-vs. oranges comparison between the Chinese navy and U.S. Navy totals,
because the Chinese total excludes certain ship types, such as auxiliary and support ships, while the U.S. Navy
total includes auxiliary and support ships, but excludes patrol craft (although the U.S. Navy has very few patrol
craft).

Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. Consistent with the DOD report,
which shows data for China for the year prior to the report's publication date, the U.S. Navy data here shows data
for the year prior to the prior to the DOD report's publication date. For example, the figure of 294 shown for the U.S.
Navy for 2022 shows the number of U.S. Navy ships at the end of FY2021. As shown elsewhere in this CRS report,
China reportedly commissioned its first two LHAs in 2021 and a third in 2022. The 2023 edition of the DOD report is
the first to show a separate figure for LHAs.

Notes: The DOD report generally covers events of the prior calendar year. Thus, the 2021 edition covers events

As shown in Table 3, the U.S. Navy projects that between 2020 and 2040, the total number of Chinese ships of the
types shown in the table will increase by 94, or about 39%, with most of that increase (77 ships out of 94) coming
from roughly equal increases in numbers of large surface combatants (cruisers and destroyers - 39 ships) and small
surface combatants (frigates and corvettes - 38 ships). Numbers of ballistic missile submarines and nuclear-
powered attack submarines are each projected to more than double between 2020 and 2040, and the total number
of diesel attack submarines is projected to remain almost unchanged. The number of large surface combatants is
projected to almost double, and the number of small surface combatants is projected to increase by more than one-
third. Numbers of larger (LHA- and LPD-type) amphibious ships are projected to increase, and the number of
smaller (LST-type) amphibious ships is projected to decline, with the result that the total number of amphibious
ships of all kinds is projected to decline slightly.

Selected Elements of China's Naval Modernization Effort

This section provides a brief overview of elements of China's naval modernization effort that have attracted frequent
attention from observers.

Anti-Ship Missiles

Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs)

China is fielding two types of land-based ballistic missiles with a capability of hitting ships at sea at extended ranges
- the DF-21D (Figure 2), a road-mobile anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) with a range of more than 1,500 kilometers
(i.e., more than 810 nautical miles), and the DF-26 (Figure 3), a road-mobile, multi-role intermediate range ballistic
missile (IRBM) with a maximum range of 3,000 kilometers to 4,000 kilometers/34 (i.e., about 1,620 nautical miles to
2,160 nautical miles) that DOD says "is designed to rapidly swap conventional and nuclear warheads and is
capable of conducting precision land-attack and anti-ship strikes in the Western Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and the
SCS [South China Sea] from mainland China."/35

34 2023 DOD CMSD, p. 66. A map on page 69 of the report shows the DF-26 with a range of 4,000 kilometers.

35 2023 DOD CMSD, p. 67. The report similarly states on page 89: "The DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile
is a capable of ranging Guam and is capable of conducting nuclear, precision conventional, and maritime attacks."

Until 2020, reported test flights of DF-21s and SDF-26s had not involved attempts to hit moving ships at sea. A

from the U.S. government side, that China's People's Liberation Army has successfully tested an anti-ship ballistic
missile against a moving ship."/37

Observers have expressed strong concerns about China's ASBMs, because such missiles, in combination with
broad-area maritime surveillance and targeting systems, would permit China to attack aircraft carriers, other U.S.
Navy ships, or ships of allied or partner navies operating in the Western Pacific. The U.S. Navy has not previously
faced a threat from highly accurate ballistic missiles capable of hitting moving ships at sea. For this reason, some
observers have referred to ASBMs as a "game-changing" weapon.

In April 2022, it was reported that China may have developed a new type of ASBM, perhaps designated the YJ-21,
that is small enough to fit into the vertical launch tube of a surface combatant, and that China had test fired such a
weapon from a Type 055 cruiser (or large destroyer)./38

China reportedly is developing hypersonic glide vehicles that, if incorporated into Chinese ASBMs, could make
Chinese ASBMs more difficult to intercept. A February 2, 2023, press report states

For the first time, the PLA has officially revealed the performance of its advanced antiship hypersonic missile,
sending a warning to the US amid high tensions in the Taiwan Strait, Chinese analysts said.

China's YJ-21, or Eagle Strike-21, has a terminal speed of Mach 10, cannot be intercepted by any anti-missile
weapons system in the world and can launch lethal strikes towards enemy ships, according to an article posted by
the official Weibo account of the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force on Monday [January 30]....

The article declares that the missile travels six times the speed of sound all the way, and has a terminal speed of 10
times the speed of sound, meaning a speed of 3,400 metres per second (11,155 feet per second) when it hits the
target.

"Such a terminal speed cannot be intercepted by any anti-missile weapon system at this stage. Even if it is dropped
directly at this terrifying speed [hitting the target] without an explosion it will cause a fatal strike to the enemy ship,"
the article stated.
