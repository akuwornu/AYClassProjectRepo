PR NewswireARLINGTON, Va., Feb. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The future of national security will depend on our
ability to command the next-generation of uncrewed airspace. To protect against tomorrow's threats, BlueHalo has
introduced VigilantHaloâ€“a software-driven integration platform for real-time airspace Command-and-Control (C2).
VigilantHalo's versatile design supports multiple missions including air traffic control (ATC), beyond visual line-of-
sight (BVLOS), and Counter-Uncrewed Aerial Systems (C-UAS). In addition to its national security and National
Airspace System (NAS) air traffic control capabilities, VigilantHalo is a complete situational awareness solution for
disaster response and critical infrastructure defense with radar and multi-sensor surveillance that can be tailored to
suit specific mission and application needs and deployed to cloud, mobile, or fixed-site installations."Drones are
rapidly evolving our national security landscape and will soon transform commerce, transportation, and many other
elements of our daily lives," said James Batt, BlueHalo Chief Growth Officer.

"VigilantHalo is a critical tool for our government and industry partners to implement now in order to keep our
airways and communities safe in the future."With VigilantHalo's integrated data processing, fusion tracker, and
communications system, an operator can monitor and separate air traffic in any environment and receive critical
internal and external system health management. Informed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) mesoscale predictions and weather stations, the system provides weather-based flight path analytics
services and identifies potential safety risks. It is powered by a custom-built state-of-the-art Sensor Data Processor
(SDP) that fuses diverse sensor types and surveillance data feeds into a consolidated display tailored to the
mission(s) of interest (e.g., ATC, BVLOS, Air Defense, BMC2, Missile Defense, etc.).BlueHalo recently revealed
VigilantHalo during a demonstration for various military leaders, state officials, and industry partners at Camp
Atterbury in Edinburgh, Indiana. BlueHalo highlighted VigilantHalo's BVLOS UAS mission controls, detect and avoid
(DAA) capabilities, and non-cooperative or nefarious UAS and C-UAS detection and tracking. VigilantHalo was
installed within a Nomad Tactical Command Vehicle for the demonstration to showcase its mobility, ease of
integration, and flexible application to address unique mission needs."Our customers are excited about this system
because it fills a giant void for complete UAS and C-UAS airspace command and control," said Mary Clum,
BlueHalo Sector President. "VigilantHalo is another example of how BlueHalo is meeting the mission with
technological     innovation      to    support      our   warfighters."To    learn     more      about   VigilantHalo,
