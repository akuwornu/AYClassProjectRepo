OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 23 -- Gov. Brad Henry, D-Okla., issued the following press release:

The nation's Governors met at the White House today with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris,
Cabinet members and senior White House advisers to discuss bipartisan priorities.

Governors of more than 40 states and territories are attending the National Governors Association (NGA) Winter
Meeting this week in Washington, D.C., to discuss bipartisan solutions to housing affordability, artificial
intelligence risks, workforce development, disaster response and other priorities.

In a wide-ranging discussion at the White House, Governors called on Congress and the Administration to work
together to address national challenges.

"Governors agree that overcoming our nation's challenges requires working together - across party lines and across
state lines," said Governor Cox. "We can't let political division get in the way of good policy. We welcome the
opportunity to work with the White House and with Congress on finding bipartisan solutions to border security,
economic stability and other challenges."
