Strategic Announcements

Today's announcements accelerate NCR Voyix's long-term strategic objective to optimize the Company's
operations and drive shareholder value. The initial part of this multi-faceted plan was achieved in October 2023 with
the completion of the spin-off of the Company's ATM business into an independent publicly traded company, NCR
Atleos. Following the spin-off, the NCR Voyix Board continued efforts to streamline the business and sharpen the
Company's focus to better serve its customers and drive value for shareholders.

The proceeds of the Digital Banking transaction will primarily be used to reduce leverage on NCR Voyix's balance
sheet. The Company expects its net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.0x net debt/Adjusted EBITDA on a pro
forma basis after the completion of the aforementioned transactions and the pay-down of a portion of its debt. The
Company is also executing a multi-phase cost alignment program that began with the elimination of approximately
$75 million in annualized payroll costs, including operational and capitalized costs, as of the end of the second
quarter. Further work is underway to identify an additional $30 million of annualized non-payroll spend expected to
be eliminated from operational and capital costs once the Digital Banking transaction has closed and the
outsourced design and manufacturing agreement has been implemented. This program contemplates an ongoing
assessment of all costs.

Together, it is anticipated that these actions will significantly reduce leverage, moderate the variability of hardware-
related revenue beginning in 2025, align NCR Voyix's current operating costs to the new structure, and position the
Company for accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion.

Sale of Digital Banking Business to Veritas Capital
    •   Veritas will acquire NCR Voyix's industry-leading Digital Banking business, which provides banks and
        credit unions with a fully integrated and seamless customer experience for consumer and business
        banking across channels, leveraging the largest independent platform of its kind in the United States. With
        over 1,600 employees across seven global facilities, the digital banking business generated $579 million in
        revenue in 2023 from approximately 1,300 financial institutions.
    •   The purchase price consists of a cash payment of $2.45 billion and contingent consideration of up to $100
        million in cash based on the achievement of the buyer's return at the time of any future exit.
    •   The transaction is expected to close by year-end 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including
        regulatory approvals.
    •   Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC served as financial advisor and King & Spalding LLP served as legal counsel to
        NCR Voyix.

New Commercial Agreement, Transitioning Point-of-Sale ("POS") and Self-Checkout ("SCO") Hardware to an
Outsourced Design and Manufacturing ("ODM") Model
    •   NCR Voyix will transition its POS and SCO hardware business to an ODM model with leading hardware
        provider Ennoconn.

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 16
                     NCR Voyix Reports Second Quarter Results and Announces Strategic Actions

    •     Once the agreement is implemented, NCR Voyix will continue to sell hardware to its customers as a sales
          agent; however, all other aspects of the hardware sale, including design, manufacturing, and warranty of
          the hardware, will be fulfilled by Ennoconn.
    •     NCR Voyix expects to recognize only the net sales commissions related to hardware sales after the
          agreement is implemented.

NCR Voyix management will discuss the transactions on its second quarter earnings conference call today at 8:00
a.m. Eastern Time, the details of which are described later in this release.

Financial Outlook

The Company is updating its full year 2024 guidance to reflect the strategic announcements described above,
including the classification of our Digital Banking business as a discontinued operation beginning in the third quarter
of fiscal 2024 as a result of the planned divestiture, which results in the removal of Digital Banking results from our
outlook and results of operations for the full year and all prior periods, as follows:

                                                                          Full Year
        Software Revenue                                                  $1,000M - $1,020M
        Services Revenue                                                  $1,040M - $1,060M
        Hardware Revenue                                                  $765M - $780M
        Total Revenue                                                     $2,805M - $2,860M
        Adj. EBITDA (cont. ops.)                                          $355M - $375M
        Adj. EBITDA (%)                                                   12.6% - 13.1%

In addition, the Company is providing the following supplemental full year 2024 outlook on a pro forma basis to give
effect to the divestiture of the Digital Banking business and the application of the proceeds from the sale to pay
down outstanding indebtedness, the ongoing expense reduction actions and the transition of the Company's POS
and SCO hardware businesses to an ODM model, as if all such transactions and actions had occurred on January
1, 2024, in order to enhance investors' ability to evaluate and compare the Company's operations on a go-forward
basis, reflecting the impact of these transactions and actions.

In this release, we use certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures include "Adjusted EBITDA,"
"Adjusted EBITDA Margin," "Non-GAAP diluted EPS," "Adjusted Free Cash Flow-Unrestricted," "Conversion Rate,"
"Net Leverage Ratio," "Normalized Revenue," "Normalized Adjusted EBITDA," and "Normalized Adjusted EBITDA
Margin," and others with the words "non-GAAP" or "normalized" in their titles. These non-GAAP measures are
listed, described and reconciled for historic periods to their most directly comparable GAAP measures under the

                                                                                                           Page 4 of 16
                    NCR Voyix Reports Second Quarter Results and Announces Strategic Actions

heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" later in this release. Our Adjusted EBITDA for historic periods after giving
effect to the spin-off of NCR Atleos includes certain costs historically allocated to NCR Atleos that do not meet the
definition of expenses related to discontinued operations for purposes of GAAP requirements regarding the
reporting of discontinued operations. Accordingly, our guidance for Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 is more comparable to
our historical Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, which includes an adjustment for these estimated costs. With respect
to our Adjusted EBITDA outlook for full year 2024 on an actual and pro forma basis and our pro forma outlook for
our anticipated Net Leverage Ratio, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin, our Adjusted Free Cash Flow-Unrestricted and
our Conversion Rate, we do not provide a reconciliation of the GAAP measure because we are not able to predict
with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may affect the GAAP net income from continuing operations and
GAAP cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are
primarily the future impact of special tax items, capital structure transactions, restructuring, pension mark-to-market
transactions, acquisitions or divestitures, or other events. These reconciling items are uncertain, depend on various
factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the GAAP measures. The Company
also believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to
investors.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP Financial Measures. While the Company reports its results in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States, or GAAP, in this release the Company also uses the non-GAAP
measures listed and described below. The Company's definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures
may differ from similarly-titled measures reported by other companies and cannot, therefore, be compared with
similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes
for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA
margin. The Company determines Adjusted EBITDA for a given period based on its GAAP net income from
continuing operations attributable to NCR Voyix plus interest expense, net; plus income tax expense (benefit); plus
depreciation and amortization (excluding acquisition-related amortization of intangibles); plus stock-based
compensation expense; plus other income (expense); plus pension mark-to-market adjustments and other special
items, including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, separation-related costs, cyber ransomware incident
recovery costs (net of insurance recoveries), fraudulent ACH disbursements costs, transformation and restructuring
charges (which includes integration, severance and other exit and disposal costs), acquisition-related costs, foreign
currency devaluation related costs, and strategic initiative costs, among others. Separation-related costs include
costs incurred as a result of the spin-off. Professional and other fees to effect the spin-off including separation
management, organizational design, and legal fees have been classified within discontinued operations through
October 16, 2023, the separation date. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated
based on Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin to manage and measure the performance of its business segments. The Company also uses
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to manage and determine the effectiveness of its business
managers and as a basis for incentive compensation. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors because they are indicators of the strength and performance
of the Company's ongoing business operations, including its ability to fund discretionary spending such as capital
expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other investments. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should
not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR
Voyix or net profit margin, respectively, under GAAP.

Normalized Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Normalized Adjusted
EBITDA) and Normalized Revenue. The Company determines Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for a given period by
further adjusting its Adjusted EBITDA for estimated costs historically allocated to NCR Atleos that do not meet the
definition of expenses related to discontinued operations for purposes of GAAP requirements regarding the
reporting of discontinued operations. Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Revenue also removes
revenue and for Normalized Adjusted EBITDA the costs associated with the transfer or pending transfer of NCR
Atleos-related operations in all foreign countries that have not occurred by March 31, 2024 from Adjusted EBITDA.
In addition, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Revenue adjusts for all divestitures that occurred in prior
periods that are not treated as discontinued operations under GAAP. The Company uses Normalized Adjusted
EBITDA and Normalized Revenue to estimate the performance of the continuing business following the spin-off.
The Company believes that Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Revenue provide useful information to
investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company's ongoing business operations
following the spin-off and allow for more easy comparisons period over period.

Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). The Company determines Non-GAAP EPS by excluding, as
applicable, pension mark-to-market adjustments, pension settlements, pension curtailments and pension special
termination benefits, as well as other special items, including amortization of acquisition related intangibles, stock-
based compensation expense, separation-related costs, cyber ransomware incident recovery costs, fraudulent ACH
disbursements costs, strategic initiative costs, foreign currency devaluation costs, costs related to the disposal of
businesses, and transformation and restructuring activities, from the Company's GAAP earnings per share. Due to

                                                                                                       Page 7 of 16

the non-operational nature of these pension and other special items, the Company's management uses these non-
GAAP measures to evaluate year-over-year operating performance. The Company believes this measure is useful
for investors because it provides a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational
performance, as well as consistency and comparability with the Company's past reports of financial results.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow-Unrestricted and Conversion Rate. NCR Voyix management uses the non-GAAP
measure called "adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted" and "conversion rate" to assess the financial performance of
the Company. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital
expenditures for property, plant and equipment, less additions to capitalized software, plus/minus net reductions or
reinvestments in the trade receivables facility due to fluctuations in the outstanding balance of receivables sold,
restricted cash settlement activity, NCR Atleos settlement activity, net cash provided by (used in) environmental
discontinued operations plus acquisition-related items, and plus pension contributions and settlements. NCR Atleos
settlement activity relates to changes in amounts owed to and amounts due from NCR Atleos for activity related to
items governed by the separation and distribution agreement. Activity from the commercial and transition services
agreements are not included in this adjustment. We define conversion rate as adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted
divided by Adjusted EBITDA. We believe adjusted free cash flow-unrestricted and conversion rate information is
useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flows from the Company's continuing and discontinued
operations to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations and the Company's ability to
convert Adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available
after capital expenditures for, among other things, investments in the Company's existing businesses, strategic
acquisitions, and repayment of debt obligations. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available
for discretionary expenditures, since there may be other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from
the measure. Free cash flow and conversion rate do not have uniform definitions under GAAP, and therefore the
Company's definitions may differ from other companies' definitions of these measures. These non-GAAP measures
should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities under GAAP.

Net Debt and Net Leverage Ratio. NCR Voyix management uses non-GAAP measures called "net debt" and "net
leverage ratio" to assess the financial performance of the Company. We define net debt as total debt minus cash
and cash equivalents. NCR Voyix's management considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and an
indicator of our ability to meet ongoing obligations. Net leverage ratio is calculated as net debt divided by last-
twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA. NCR Voyix's management considers net leverage ratio to be an important
indicator of the Company's indebtedness in relation to its operating performance. The Company's definition of net
debt and net leverage ratio may differ from other companies' definitions of each measure, and each measure
should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, comparable GAAP metrics.

Non-GAAP Pro Forma Outlook. The supplemental non-GAAP pro forma financial outlook in this press release is not
necessarily indicative of the operating results of the Company were the divestiture of the Digital Banking business
and the application of the proceeds from the sale to pay off outstanding indebtedness, the ongoing expense
reduction actions and the transition of the Company's POS and SCO hardware businesses to an ODM model
effected as of or before January 1, 2024 or of the operating results of the Company in the future. The supplemental
non-GAAP pro forma financial outlook included in this press release is not pro forma information prepared in
accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the SEC, and the preparation of information in accordance with
Article 11 would result in a different presentation. The Company will publish historical pro forma financial
information in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the SEC to give effect to the divestiture of the Digital
Banking business in connection with the closing of the transaction.
