By Thomas Frank Artificial intelligence could saves lives during major storms, floods and wildfires by enabling
weather forecasters to provide faster and more accurate information that gives the public extra warning time,
according to a government report. The Government Accountability Office says that researchers using AI can
analyze more data "to significantly improve the timeliness, accuracy, and precision of natural disaster forecasting."
AI has the potential to "significantly speed up" forecasting, leading to "more timely responses that can save lives
and property," the GAO wrote in a report to Congress.

In flood modeling, AI can complete some types of analysis "about 1,000 times faster than the traditional model," the
GAO found. Accurate and precise forecasting is increasingly important as climate change intensifies extreme
weather and as a growing number of people live in areas vulnerable to hurricanes, floods and wildfires. Hurricane
intensity and intensification, for example, remain famously difficult to forecast even as models are predicting
hurricane paths more accurately. Floods are "very difficult" to predict because models require extensive data that
takes a long time to process, the GAO reported. The processing time makes flood models of limited use in
predicting flash floods, which occur suddenly when a stream or stormwater system overflows. And severe storms
including tornadoes are "difficult" to forecast because they cover small areas and computer models "are not able to
predict at this small of a scale," the GAO wrote. The GAO's report to Congress echoes a pair of studies published in
July that tout the potential of AI to improve weather forecasting. The report comes as the U.S. government is
rushing to promote AI in both the private sector and public while also seeking to protect privacy and security.
President Joe Biden issued an executive order in October or planning to use AI. The new GAO report warns that
the limited understanding of AI could create some hesitancy in adopting certain types of AI in catastrophe
forecasting. But AI "can be used in many ways" to model severe weather and can produce "multiple benefits," the
report says. The main benefits of AI are its capacity to analyze far more data than current computer models, which
were launched in the 1960s, and its ability to process information far more quickly. AI can "provide a more accurate
picture" of extreme weather conditions by analyzing additional conditions such as information from satellites "that is
significantly underused," the GAO said. For wildfires, additional data capacity would help computer models
determine the dryness of forests and grasslands over vast areas. The GAO, which is Congress' investigative
agency, released the report in December to help guide policymakers as they seek to increase the use of AI in
severe weather forecasting while also preventing it from being misused. The report contains "policy options"
including incentives for government workers to develop AI, an expansion of access to relevant government data
and the requirement that certain federal employees learn AI in an effort to increase education on the topic.
