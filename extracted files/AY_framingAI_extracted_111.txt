Management Commentary

“TeraWulf's second-quarter results reflect our unwavering commitment to operational excellence and strategic
growth. By completing the construction of Building 4 at Lake Mariner, advancing our AI and high-performance
computing initiatives, and streamlining our capital structure, we have solidified our position as a leader in the
industry. Our focus on low-cost, predominantly zero-carbon energy and efficient management has enabled us to
achieve industry-leading profitability while positioning us to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the rapidly
growing data center market,” said Paul Prager, CEO of TeraWulf.

“Our extensive 600 megawatts of owned and scalable infrastructure is a key differentiator, allowing us to leverage
our success in bitcoin mining as the foundation for expanding into alternative compute hosting. This strategic move
aligns perfectly with the increasing demand for high-power data center capacity, positioning us for long-term growth
and profitability,” continued Prager.

Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf’s CFO added, “In the second quarter of 2024, TeraWulf delivered solid financial
performance, even in a challenging fundamental business environment following the Bitcoin reward halving in April,
mining a total of 699 bitcoin across our facilities. During the quarter, we maintained our focus on cost management,
achieving quarter-over-quarter reductions in power costs at Lake Mariner and SG&A expenses. In addition, our
robust balance sheet, highlighted by a strong cash position and the elimination of debt, positions us well for future
growth. We remain committed to maximizing shareholder value as we diversify into HPC and AI expansion in the
latter half of the year."

Production and Operations Update

The recent completion of Building 4 at the Company's wholly owned Lake Mariner Facility in New York has
expanded TeraWulf’s bitcoin mining infrastructure capacity to 245 MW and over 10.0 EH/s across its two sites. The

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 10
                              TeraWulf Reports Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results

Company has also begun construction on Building 5 at the Lake Mariner Facility, which is expected to contribute an
additional 50 MW of infrastructure capacity by Q1 2025. This capacity can be utilized for bitcoin mining or AI/HPC
compute applications.

In Pennsylvania, the Company currently has 50 MW of operational mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine
Facility, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. TeraWulf’s additional 50 MW of expansion capacity at the Nautilus
Cryptomine Facility is planned to come online in 2025, potentially increasing TeraWulf’s bitcoin mining operating
capacity by up to 2.5 EH/s at the site.

As previously announced, the Company is advancing activities to support a large-scale, high-performance
computing (HPC) and AI project at the Lake Mariner Facility. The Company has committed an initial 2 MW block of
power to the project, capable of supporting thousands of the latest generation graphics processing units (GPUs).
During the second quarter, the Company purchased a 128-GPU cluster from NVIDIA, financed by a leading OEM.
To support this project, the Company has upgraded the internet interconnection at the Lake Mariner Facility to meet
the bandwidth requirements of AI, designed a closed-loop liquid cooling system, and ensured power supply
redundancy for 100% reliability.

Second Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results

Revenue in the second quarter of 2024 increased 130.2% to $35.6 million as compared to $15.5 million in the
second quarter of 2023. This increase is attributable to a significant growth in operating self-mining hashrate as well
as a higher average bitcoin price relative to the second quarter of 2023. Notably, revenue and expenses reported in
the TeraWulf GAAP income statement excludes revenue and expenses from the Nautilus joint venture; the net
financial impact of the Nautilus joint venture is captured within equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax in
the consolidated statements of operations.

Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) in the second quarter of 2024 increased 109.4% to $21.7 million compared
to $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 60.9%
in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 66.9% in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to an approximate
doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024, partially offset by a 105.6% increase in
average operating hashrate and 135.9% increase in average value per bitcoin self-mined year-over-year.

During the second quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $30.2 million of debt, followed by an additional $75.8
million repayment in July 2024 to fully pay down the remaining balance on the Term Loans ahead of maturity.

Non-GAAP Measure

To provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a non-
GAAP measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be
considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with
GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) impacts of interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party
expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes are
not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment,
and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net income
(loss) of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) other income which is related to interest income or income for
which management believes is not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) loss on
extinguishment of debt, which is not reflective of the Company’s general business performance; and (vi) loss from
discontinued operations, net of tax, which is not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The
Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin
related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction with excluding the
impact of equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in
its ongoing operations as a result of its investment in Nautilus.

Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful comparisons between
the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an
important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating
results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA,
management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing the Company’s
performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case
even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although

                                                                                                           Page 9 of 10
                              TeraWulf Reports Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results

management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate the
Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense,
which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years
and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants.
Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the
Company’s bitcoin related revenue.

The Company's Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other
companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP
financial results differently. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under
GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating loss or any other measure of performance
derived in accordance with GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the
Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to,
the information provided by GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in
isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly
comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable to common stockholders) for the periods indicated (in
thousands):

1 Excludes BTC earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at
the Lake Mariner Facility and includes TeraWulf's net share of BTC produced at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.2
The Company’s share of the earnings or losses of operating results at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is reflected
within “Equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax” in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly,
operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of
operations lines in TeraWulf’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses these metrics as
indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes
and to provide comparisons to peer companies. All figures except Bitcoin Self-Mined are estimates.3 Excludes BTC
earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner
Facility and TeraWulf’s net share of BTC produced at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.4 Computed as the weighted-
average opening price of BTC on each respective day the Self-Mined Bitcoin is earned.5 The Q2 2024 and Q2
2023 calculations excludes 0 and 17 bitcoin, respectively, earned via hosting profit share.6 While nameplate
inventory for TeraWulf’s two facilities is 8.8 EH/s, actual monthly hash rate performance depends on a variety of
factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled
outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in
various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC
maintenance and repair.
