introduction of support for Google Cloud adds onto MongoDB's existing availability withother cloud solutions,
making MongoDB Atlas for Government the first multi-cloud data platform authorized at FedRAMP Moderate.

 "Google Cloud's Assured Workloads gives public sector organizations access to the latest cloud capabilities
without having to worry about compromising on compliance," said Sunil Potti, Vice President, Cloud Security at
Google Cloud. "We're excited to provide these organizations with even further flexibility by adding MongoDB Atlas
for Government as another database option for them to choose."The public sector and the ISVs that serve these
organizations must balance maintaining the highest levels of security and remaining compliant with regulatory
requirements—while continuing to adopt advanced technology to meet the ever-growing needs of citizens.With

platform that supports a wide range of use cases, including mission-critical transactional workloads, generative AI-
