PR NewswireLAND O'LAKES, Fla. and MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Sept. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Retail Process
Engineering, LLC ("RPE"), a leading supply chain IT consulting firm, has joined forces with Capstone Integrated
Solutions LLC ("Capstone"), a full-service software and technology services company, on the IT Services Platform
created by Conanicut Capital. Both RPE and Capstone have grown up in the retail sector and today provide
complementary tech-enabled solutions across a growing list of enterprise-level customers, providing the platform a
broader offering of IT services and capabilities.

 "RPE has decades of experience within supply chain systems such as merchandising, planning, allocation,
assortment, and replenishment working with best-in-class retail and wholesale customers on their complex system
needs," said Rob Henneke, president, RPE. "The new partnership with Capstone will provide both RPE and
Capstone the opportunity to cross-sell our collective IT services into a growing base of customers.""Providing
enterprise-level customers with top-tier, differentiated solutions without losing that boutique, subject matter
expertise is the goal of each of our organizations," said Eli Burstein, president, Capstone. "Our organizations' past
success has been a function of our expert practitioners who deliver for our customers every day. That cultural
alignment will continue to drive our SME-driven focus and provide our customers a greater breadth of services to
propel their unique digital realization journeys.""Our original thesis for the platform was to find growing, specialist
(channel and sector) IT services firms, like Capstone and RPE, that through cross-platform relationships could be
much more relevant to their customers' digital challenges," said Jared Paquette, Managing Partner, Conanicut
Capital. "It starts and ends with the expert-level specialists. We look forward to ongoing growth investments for the
platform as well as finding similar-minded firms that can provide additional complementary services to the growing
IT Services Platform."With support from Conanicut Capital, this partnership between RPE and Capstone is an
integral next step in the platform's long-term strategy to deepen its broad, scalable set of IT capabilities across
implementation, development, consulting, and managed services. Conanicut plans to identify future strategic
opportunities for partnership to further scale the platform and drive value for clients and employees.About
