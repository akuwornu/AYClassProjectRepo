biopharmaceutical Company. ACXP is developing a new class of small molecular antibiotics for life-threatening
bacterial infections. With the successful completion of Phase 2 clinical trials on the Ibezapolstat drug, a treatment
for patients with Clostridioides difficile Infections (CDI), management met with the FDA to map out a pathway for a
full FDA drug approval. David tells viewers that the meeting was successful and that the FDA and ACXP agreed on
a Phase 3 clinical trial protocol. Once fully approved, the Company will have the opportunity to pursue worldwide
partnerships and revenue-streaming agreements. Over the next couple of years, David and the ACXP team expect
a successful Phase 3 trial with full FDA approval. ACXP believes Ibezapolstat could be a market worth over $1B. As
such, its shareholder base and stock prices could greatly benefit once the regulatory agencies in the USA and
internationally approve the drug. Clinical data to date on completed trials have shown that the Ibezapolstat drug
effectively treats CDI with no reinfections. The on-screen QR code is available during the show; download or visit
