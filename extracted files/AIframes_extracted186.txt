Her Excellency Patricia Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations, visited the National
Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) at NDMA HQs this afternoon. Chairman NDMA Lieutenant General Inam
Haider Malik provided a comprehensive briefing to the distinguished visitor on the NEOC's capabilities, which are
bolstered by multiple satellite feeds, software applications, and artificial intelligence tools. These resources
enable the NEOC to generate a National Common Operating Picture (NCOP), enhancing digital risk assessment,
early warning systems, risk communication and preparedness strategies for Pakistan. During the meeting, Pak
NDMA team elaborated on the operational procedures of NDMA, emphasizing how the NEOC serves as a central
hub for emergency response and coordination. It facilitates collaboration among Provincial Disaster Management
Authorities (PDMAs), District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs), relevant ministries, departments, and
other stakeholders, including domestic and international humanitarian partners. This seamless coordination ensures
swift and effective responses during all phases of disasters, particularly in the pre-disaster stage. Chairman NDMA
