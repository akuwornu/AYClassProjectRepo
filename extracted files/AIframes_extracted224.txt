Body

FalconStor Software today announces certification of both StorSafe and StorGuard with IBM Storage Ceph,
accelerating customers' "Journey to AI" through improved data access, migration, and availability. FalconStor's
flagship solutions, StorSafe and StorGuard, deliver a comprehensive suite of data and backup optimization,
virtualization, and protection, from on-premises to hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. IBM Storage Ceph is a
scale-out, software-defined unified storage solution designed to support data lakes for IBM watsonx.data and next-
generation AI workloads. Together, these solutions provide enterprise application access, data migration,
protection, and availability, enabling customers to harness their massive data stores to tackle previously unsolvable
challenges using Generative AI.

StorSafe is Now Certified with Storage Ceph

IBM has certified FalconStor StorSafe with Storage Ceph, IBM's on-premises AI data lake offering, ensuring
compatibility and full support by IBM. StorSafe is the only IBM-certified, sold, and supported solution for backup
optimization with IBM Power Virtual Server, available via the IBM Cloud Catalog. Now, with certification for IBM
Storage Ceph, customers can leverage both for an enterprise-class backup solution.

StorSafe integrates with any leading backup software on IBM Power (IBM i/AIX/Linux) or mixed heterogeneous
operating systems, utilizing advanced compression and patented block-level deduplication to optimize backup and
recovery operations while simplifying workload and data migrations. IBM Storage Ceph object storage is now
supported as the tape archive export target for StorSafe, offering customers low-cost storage to archive historical
backup data.

StorGuard is Now Certified with Storage Ceph

FalconStor has certified StorGuard with Storage Ceph, ensuring seamless integration and full support by
FalconStor. StorGuard offers storage virtualization, business continuity, high availability, system failover, and data
migration. Key capabilities brought to Storage Ceph by StorGuard include:
    •     Fibre Channel and iSCSI support enabling enterprise application connection to Storage Ceph

                                                                                                Page 2 of 3

    •   Data mobility via migration from heterogeneous storage environments into Storage Ceph as well as into
        the cloud
    •   Data protection across hybrid and multi-cloud environments
    •   Fast, easy deployment and simplified management

IBM Storage Ceph provides an efficient way to build a data lakehouse for IBM watsonx.data and next-generation AI
workloads. It is highly scalable, with no single point of failure, and can support petabytes of data and billions of
objects. StorGuard enhances Storage Ceph's capabilities by expanding enterprise application support, facilitating
data migration from non-Ceph storage, and ensuring full data protection and high availability.

"StorGuard has been a critical component of our enterprise data protection strategy for many years," said Stefan
Teusch, Deputy Head of GWDG and UMG/G3-7 - Infrastructure Operations Division, GWDG. "Certification of Ceph
is an exciting and valuable addition as we think about the future storage, management, and use of massive
amounts of data."
